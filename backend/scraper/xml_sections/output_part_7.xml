<P>A sample of a batch of color additive which is to accompany a request for certification shall:
</P>
<P>(a) Be taken only after such batch has been so thoroughly mixed as to be of uniform composition throughout.
</P>
<P>(b) Held under the control of the person requesting certification until certified.

<P>(a) If the Commissioner determines, after such investigations as he considers to be necessary, that:
</P>
<P>(1) A request submitted in accordance with § 80.21 appears to contain no untrue statement of a material fact;
</P>
<P>(2) Such color additive conforms to the specifications and any other conditions set forth therefor in parts 81 and 82 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(3) The batch covered by such request otherwise appears to comply with the regulations in this chapter, the Commissioner shall issue to the person who submitted such request a certificate showing the lot number assigned to such batch and that such batch, subject to the terms, conditions, and restrictions prescribed by part 74, 81, and 82 of this chapter, is a certified batch.
</P>
<P>(b) If the Commissioner determines, after such investigation as he considers to be necessary, that a request submitted in accordance with § 80.21, or the batch of color additive covered by such request, does not comply with the requirements prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section for the issuance of a certificate, the Commissioner shall refuse to certify such batch and shall give notice thereof to the person who submitted such request, stating his reasons for refusal. Any person who contests such refusal shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to part 16 of this chapter.

<P>(a) If a certificate is obtained through fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact, such certificate shall not be effective, and a color additive from the batch on which such certificate was issued shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified in accordance with the regulations in this part. Whenever, the Commissioner learns that any certificate has been obtained through fraud or material misrepresentation, he shall notify the holder of the certificate that it is of no effect.
</P>
<P>(b) If between the time a sample of color additive accompanying a request for certification is taken and the time a certificate covering the batch of such color additive is received by the person to whom it is issued, any such color additive becomes changed in composition, such certificates shall not be effective with respect to such changed color additive and such changed color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified in accordance with the regulations in this part.
</P>
<P>(c) If at any time after a certificate is received by the person to whom it is issued any color additive from the batch covered by such certificate becomes changed in composition, such certificate shall expire with respect to such changed color additive. After such expiration, such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified in accordance with this part; except that such color additive shall not be so considered when used for coloring a food, drug, or cosmetic, or for the purpose of certifying a batch of a mixture in which such color additive was used as an ingredient, or for use in preparing a batch of a mixture for which exemption from certification has been authorized, if such change resulted solely from such use.
</P>
<P>(d) A certificate shall expire with respect to any color additive covered thereby if the package in which such color additive was closed for shipment or delivery is opened. After such expiration such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified, except that such color additive shall not be so considered when the package is opened;
</P>
<P>(1) and such color additive is used, subject to the restrictions prescribed by paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section, in coloring a food, drug, or cosmetic;
</P>
<P>(2) for the purpose of certifying a batch made by repacking such color;
</P>
<P>(3) for the purpose of certifying a batch of a mixture in which such color is used as an ingredient; or
</P>
<P>(4) for the purpose of preparing a batch of a mixture for which exemption from certification has been authorized; or
</P>
<P>(5) when the package is reopened solely for repackaging by the person to whom such certificate was issued.
</P>
<P>(e) A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package of color additive and such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified if such package is shipped or delivered under a label which does not bear all words, statements, and other information required by § 70.25 of this chapter to appear thereon.
</P>
<P>(f) A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package of color additive, and such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified if:
</P>
<P>(1) Such package has not been sealed in accordance with § 70.20 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(2) Such package has been sealed in accordance with § 70.20 of this chapter and the seal has been broken, intentionally or accidentally, unless such seal has been broken for the purpose of using color additive in accordance with § 80.38, or, such package has been opened by a duly authorized representative of the Administration or Department in the performance of his official duties, and he has immediately resealed the package in conformance with § 70.20 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(g) A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package of color additive and such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified if such color additive is used in any manner other than that for which it was certified.
</P>
<P>(h) When the listing or the specifications for a color additive are revoked or amended, the final order effecting the revocation or amendment may specify, in addition to its own effective date, a date on which all certificates for existing batches and portions of batches of such a color additive theretofore issued under such revoked or amended regulations shall cease to be effective; and any such lots of the color additive shall be regarded as uncertified after the date specified unless a new certificate can be and is obtained in conformance with the new regulations. When a certificate thus ceases to be effective for a color additive, any certificates previously issued for a color additive mixture containing that color additive shall cease to be effective on the same date. Use of such color additive or color additive mixture after such specified date without the new certificate in preparing foods, drugs, or cosmetics will result in such food, drugs, or cosmetics being adulterated. When a certified color additive has been used in food, drugs, or cosmetics and the status of the color additive is thereafter changed by amendment or revocation of its listing or specification regulations, such food, drugs, and cosmetics will not be regarded as adulterated by reason of the use of such color additive, unless the hazard to health is such that existing stocks of the foods, drugs, or cosmetics cannot be safely used, in which cases findings to that effect will be made and regulations appropriate for such special cases will be issued.

<HEAD>§ 81.10   Termination of provisional listings of color additives.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Ext. D&amp;C Yellow Nos. 9 and 10.</I> These colors cannot be produced with any assurance that they do not contain β-naphthylamine as an impurity. While it has been asserted that the two colors can be produced without the impurity named, no method of analysis has been suggested to establish the fact. β-Naphthylamine is a known carcinogen; therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for these colors in products to be used in contact with the skin. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, having concluded that such action is necessary to protect the public health, hereby terminated the provisional listing of Ext. D&amp;C Yellow No. 9 and Ext. D&amp;C Yellow No. 10.
</P>
<P>(b) [Reserved]
</P>
<P>(c) <I>FD&amp;C Red No. 1.</I> Results of recent feeding tests of this color additive have demonstrated it to be toxic upon ingestion:
</P>
<P>(1) Groups of 50 rats are being fed diets containing FD&amp;C Red No. 1 at levels of 5 percent, 2 percent, 1 percent, 0.5 percent, and 0 percent. At this stage of the tests, which have now been in progress for from 15 months to 18 months, 116 animals from the 250 being fed FD&amp;C Red No. 1 at various levels and 27 of the 100 controls have died. Of these, 11 being fed at the 5 percent level, 16 being fed at the 2 percent level, 11 being fed at the 1 percent level, and 2 being fed at the 0.5 percent level, have shown liver damage. None of the controls that have died have shown liver damage.
</P>
<P>(2) Groups of 100 mice are being fed diets containing 2 percent, 1 percent, 0.5 percent, and 0.1 percent FD&amp;C Red No. 1, with 400 mice as controls. All mice on dosage levels of 2 percent and 1 percent died before the seventieth week. Gross liver damage has been observed in all groups fed at the 0.5 percent diet and above.
</P>
<P>(3) Groups of 4 dogs are being fed diets containing 2 percent, 1 percent, 0.25 percent, and 0 percent FD&amp;C Red No. 1. Three of the dogs on the 2 percent dosage level died before 32 weeks; the other is living. Three of the dogs on the 1 percent dosage level died or were sacrificed within 13 months. All deceased or sacrificed dogs have shown liver damage grossly and/or microscopically. Deceased dogs on the 1 percent and 2 percent dosage level showed poor physical condition.
</P>
<FP>The Commissioner of Food and Drugs having concluded that ingestion of this color additive over a long period of time would be unsafe, and in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of FD&amp;C Red No. 1 for use in foods, drugs, and cosmetics.
</FP>
<P>(d) <I>FD&amp;C Red No. 4.</I> Feeding tests of this color additive have been conducted with three species:
</P>
<P>(1) Rats of the Osborne-Mendel and Sprague-Dawley strains were fed FD&amp;C Red No. 4 for 2 years at levels of 5 percent, 2 percent, 1 percent, and 0.5 percent of the diet. No effect was found.
</P>
<P>(2) Mice of the C3Hf and C57BL strains were fed FD&amp;C Red No. 4 for 2 years at levels of 2 percent and 1 percent of the diet. No effect was found.
</P>
<P>(3) Dogs were fed FD&amp;C Red No. 4 at levels of 2 percent and 1 percent of the diet. Adverse effects were found at both levels in the urinary bladder and in the adrenals. Three dogs of five fed on the 2-percent level died after 6 months, 9 months, and 5
<FR>1/2</FR> years on the test. Two of the dogs on the 2-percent level and all five of the dogs on the 1-percent level survived to the completion of the 7 year study.
</P>
<FP>The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that available data do not permit the establishment of a safe level of use of this color additive in food, ingested drugs and ingested cosmetics. In order to protect the public health, the Commissioner hereby terminates the provisional listing of FD&amp;C Red No. 4 for use in food and ingested drugs. The Commissioner has previously terminated the provisional listing of FD&amp;C Red No. 4 for use in ingested cosmetics. FD&amp;C Red No. 4 is listed for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics by §§ 74.1304 and 74.2304 of this chapter, respectively. Section 82.304 of this chapter is retained in part 82 of this chapter to permit the use of lakes of FD&amp;C Red No. 4 in externally applied drugs and cosmetics.
</FP>
<P>(e) <I>FD&amp;C Violet No. 1.</I> The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of FD&amp;C Violet No. 1 for use in foods, drugs, and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>FD&amp;C Red No. 2.</I> The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of FD&amp;C Red No. 2 for use in food, drugs, and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Carbon black</I> (<I>prepared by the “impingement” or “channel” process</I>). The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of carbon black (prepared by the <I>impingement</I> or <I>channel</I> process) for use in food, drugs, and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>D&amp;C Red Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13.</I> The petition for these color additives was withdrawn so that there no longer exists a basis for their continued provisional listing. In addition, the Commissioner has learned of the possible contamination of D&amp;C Red No. 10, D&amp;C Red No. 11, D&amp;C Red No. 12, and D&amp;C Red No. 13 with β-naphthyl-amine. The Commissioner concludes that these colors cannot be produced with any reasonable assurance that they will not contain β-naphthylamine as an impurity or not yield β-naphthylamine from the metabolism of subsidiary colors present in them. β-Naphthylamine is a known carcinogen; therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for these colors in drugs or cosmetics. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, upon withdrawal of the petition for their use and in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of D&amp;C Red No. 10, D&amp;C Red No. 11, D&amp;C Red No. 12, and D&amp;C Red No. 13 for use in drugs and cosmetics, effective December 13, 1977.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Ext. D&amp;C Yellow No. 1.</I> The Commissioner has learned of the contamination of Ext. D&amp;C Yellow No. 1 with 4-aminobiphenyl. The Commissioner concludes that this color cannot be produced with any reasonable assurance that it will not contain 4-aminobiphenyl as an impurity or not yield benzidine from the decomposition of a subsidiary reaction product that might be present in the color. 4-Aminobiphenyl and benzidine are known carcinogens; therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for these colors in drugs or cosmetics. In addition, insufficient data have been submitted to permit establishment of appropriate specifications for the batch certification of the color. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of Ext. D&amp;C Yellow No. 1 for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics, effective December 13, 1977.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Graphite.</I> Data have been developed that show the contamination of graphite with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PNA's). There is no reasonable assurance this color can be produced so that it will not contain PNA's as an impurity. The presence of certain PNA's in graphite would indicate that PNA's known to be carcinogenic to animals and humans may also be present. Therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for this color in drugs or cosmetics. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of graphite for use in externally applied cosmetics, effective November 29, 1977.
</P>
<P>(k) <I>Ext. D&amp;C Green No. 1.</I> The Commissioner concludes that there are inadequate analytical methods to permit certification of the color additive Ext. D&amp;C Green No. 1. In addition, the Commissioner has found that there was a failure to comply with the conditions attached to the postponement of the closing date in accordance with section 203(a)(2) of the transitional provisions of the Color Additive Amendments of 1960. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs hereby terminates the provisional listing of Ext. D&amp;C Green No. 1 for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics, effective November 29, 1977.
</P>
<P>(l) [Reserved]
</P>
<P>(m) <I>D&amp;C Orange Nos. 10 and 11.</I> In the absense of a petition to list D&amp;C Orange No. 10 and D&amp;C Orange No. 11 for use in ingested drugs and cosmetics, there no longer exists a basis for provisional listing for such uses. Therefore, FDA is terminating the provisional listing of D&amp;C Orange No. 10 and D&amp;C Orange No. 11 for use in ingested drugs and cosmetics, effective April 28, 1981.
</P>
<P>(n) <I>D&amp;C Blue No. 6.</I> The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, having concluded that unresolved questions remain concerning the chemistry of unidentified minor components, hereby terminates the provisional listing of D&amp;C Blue No. 6 for use in drugs and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>(o) <I>D&amp;C Green No. 6.</I> In the absence of a petition to list D&amp;C Green No. 6 for use in ingested drugs and cosmetics, there no longer exists a basis for provisional listing for such uses. Accordingly, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs hereby terminates the provisional listing of D&amp;C Green No. 6 for use in ingested drugs and cosmetics, effective March 27, 1981.
</P>
<P>(p) [Reserved]
</P>
<P>(q)(1) <I>D&amp;C Red No. 19 and D&amp;C Red No. 37.</I> Having concluded that, when ingested, D&amp;C Red No. 19 causes cancer in rats and mice, the agency hereby terminates the provisional listings of D&amp;C Red No. 19 and chemically related D&amp;C Red No. 37 for use in ingested drugs and ingested cosmetics, effective February 4, 1983.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>D&amp;C Red No. 37.</I> In the absence of a petition to list D&amp;C Red No. 37 for external uses, there no longer exists a basis for provisional listing for such uses. Accordingly, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs hereby terminates the provisional listings of D&amp;C Red No. 37 for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics, effective June 6, 1986.
</P>
<P>(r) [Reserved]
</P>
<P>(s) <I>D&amp;C Orange No. 17.</I> Having concluded that, when ingested, D&amp;C Orange No. 17 causes cancer in rats and mice, the agency has terminated the provisional listing of D&amp;C Orange No. 17 for use in ingested drugs and ingested cosmetics, effective March 31, 1983.
</P>
<P>(t) <I>D&amp;C Red No. 8 and D&amp;C Red No. 9.</I> In the absence of a petition to list D&amp;C Red No. 8 and D&amp;C Red No. 9 for mouthwash, dentifrices, and ingested drugs, except ingested drug lip products, there no longer exists a basis for provisional listing for such uses. Accordingly, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs hereby terminates the provisional listings of D&amp;C Red No. 8 and D&amp;C Red No. 9 for use in mouthwash, dentifrices, and ingested drugs, except ingested drug lip products, effective January 6, 1987.
</P>
<P>(u) <I>FD&amp;C Red No. 3.</I> Having concluded that FD&amp;C Red No. 3 causes cancer in rats, the agency hereby terminates the provisional listing of FD&amp;C Red No. 3 for use in cosmetics and externally applied drugs and the provisional listing of the lakes of FD&amp;C Red No. 3 for use in food, drug, and cosmetic products, effective January 29, 1990.

<HEAD>§ 99.205   Application for exemption from the requirement to file a supplemental application.</HEAD>
<P>(a) In certain circumstances, described in paragraph (b) of this section, a manufacturer may submit an application for an exemption from the requirement to submit a supplemental application for a new use for purposes of disseminating information on that use.
</P>
<P>(b) The manufacturer's application for an exemption shall identify the basis for the proposed exemption and shall include materials demonstrating that it would be economically prohibitive or that it would be unethical to conduct the studies necessary to submit a supplemental application for the new use.
</P>
<P>(1) If the basis for the manufacturer's application for exemption is that it would be economically prohibitive to incur the costs necessary to submit a supplemental application for a new use, the manufacturer shall, at a minimum, provide:
</P>
<P>(i) Evidence explaining why existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated, are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use. Such evidence shall include an analysis of all data relevant to the safety and effectiveness of the use, a summary of those data, and any documentation resulting from prior discussions with the agency concerning the adequacy of the existing data; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Evidence demonstrating that the cost of the study or studies for the new use reasonably exceeds the expected revenue from the new use minus the costs of goods sold and marketing and administrative expenses attributable to the new use of the product. Such evidence shall include:
</P>
<P>(A) A description of the additional studies that the manufacturer believes are necessary to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, including documentation from prior discussions, if any, with the agency concerning the studies that would be needed, and an estimate of the projected costs for such studies;
</P>
<P>(B) The expected patient population for the new use;
</P>
<P>(C) The expected revenue for the new use, including an explanation of the price at which the drug or device will be sold;
</P>
<P>(D) Any exclusivity for the drug or device for the new use; and
</P>
<P>(E) Any other information that the manufacturer has showing that conducting the studies on the new use would be economically prohibitive; and
</P>
<P>(iii) An attestation by a responsible individual of the manufacturer or an individual acting on the manufacturer's behalf verifying that the estimates included with the submission are accurate and were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures. The data underlying and supporting the estimates shall be made available to FDA upon request. Alternatively, a manufacturer may submit a report of an independent certified public accountant in accordance with the Statement of Standards for Attestation established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and agreed upon procedures performed with respect to the estimates submitted under this section.
</P>
<P>(2) If the basis for the manufacturer's application for exemption is that it would be unethical to conduct the studies necessary for the supplemental application for a new use, the manufacturer shall provide evidence:
</P>
<P>(i) Explaining why existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated, are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use. Such evidence shall include an analysis of all data relevant to the safety and effectiveness of the new use, a summary of those data, and any documentation resulting from prior discussions with the agency concerning the adequacy of the existing data; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Explaining why it would be unethical to conduct the further studies that would be necessary for the approval of the new use. Such evidence shall establish that, notwithstanding the insufficiency of available data to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, the data are persuasive to the extent that withholding the drug or device in a controlled study (e.g., by providing no therapy, a placebo, an alternative therapy, or an alternative dose) would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to human subjects. In assessing the appropriateness of conducting studies to support the new use, the manufacturer may provide evidence showing that the new use is broadly accepted as current standard medical treatment or therapy. The manufacturer shall also address the possibility of conducting studies in different populations or of modified design (e.g., adding the new therapy to existing treatments or using an alternative dose if monotherapy studies could not be conducted).

<P>(b) <I>Protocols/Studies.</I> Within 60 days after receiving a submission under this part, FDA shall:
</P>
<P>(1) If the manufacturer has planned studies that will be needed for the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, review the manufacturer's proposed protocols and schedule for completing such studies and determine whether the proposed protocols are adequate and whether the proposed schedule for completing the studies is reasonable. FDA shall notify the manufacturer of its determination; or
</P>
<P>(2) If the manufacturer has completed studies that the manufacturer believes would be an adequate basis for the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, conduct a review of the protocols submitted for such studies to determine whether they are adequate.

<P>(i) That existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use; and
</P>
<P>(ii) That the cost of the study or studies for the new use reasonably exceeds the expected revenue from the new use minus the cost of goods sold and marketing and administrative expenses attributable to the new use of the product, and there are not less expensive ways to obtain the needed information; or
</P>
<P>(2) It would be unethical to conduct clinical studies needed to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use because:
</P>
<P>(i) Existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Although available evidence would not support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, the data are persuasive to the extent that withholding the drug or device in a controlled study would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to human subjects and no studies in different populations or of modified design can be utilized. In determining whether it would be unethical to conduct clinical studies, the agency shall consider, in addition to the persuasiveness of available evidence of effectiveness, whether the new use of the drug or device is broadly accepted as current standard medical treatment or therapy.

<HEAD>§ 99.401   Corrective actions and cessation of dissemination of information.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>FDA actions based on post dissemination data.</I> If FDA receives data after a manufacturer has begun disseminating information on a new use and, based on that data, determines that the new use that is the subject of information disseminated under this part may not be effective or may present a significant risk to public health, FDA shall consult the manufacturer and, after such consultation, take appropriate action to protect the public health. Such action may include ordering the manufacturer to cease disseminating information on the new use and to take appropriate corrective action.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>FDA actions based on information disseminated by a manufacturer.</I> If FDA determines that a manufacturer is disseminating information that does not comply with the requirements under this part, FDA may:
</P>
<P>(1) Provide to the manufacturer an opportunity to bring itself into compliance with the requirements under this part if the manufacturer's noncompliance constitutes a minor violation of these requirements; or
</P>
<P>(2) Order the manufacturer to cease dissemination of information and to take corrective action. FDA shall issue such an order only after it has:
</P>
<P>(i) Provided notice to the manufacturer regarding FDA's intent to issue an order to cease dissemination; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Provided to the manufacturer an opportunity for a meeting. FDA need not provide an opportunity for a meeting if the manufacturer certified that it will submit a supplemental application for the new use within 6 months of the date that dissemination can begin and the noncompliance involves a failure to submit such supplemental application.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>FDA actions based on a manufacturer's supplemental application.</I> FDA may order a manufacturer to cease disseminating information under this part and to take corrective action if:
</P>
<P>(1) In the case of a manufacturer that has submitted a supplemental application for the new use, FDA determines that the supplemental application does not contain adequate information for approval of the new use;
</P>
<P>(2) In the case of a manufacturer that has certified that it will submit a supplemental application for the new use within 6 months, the manufacturer has not, within the 6-month period, submitted a supplemental application for the new use;
</P>
<P>(3) In the case of a manufacturer that has certified that it will submit a supplemental application for the new use within 36 months or within such time as FDA has determined to be appropriate under § 99.303(a) or (b), such manufacturer has not submitted the supplemental application within the certified time, or FDA, after an informal hearing, has determined that the manufacturer is not acting with due diligence to initiate or complete the studies necessary to support a supplemental application for the new use; or
</P>
<P>(4) In the case of a manufacturer that has certified that it will submit a supplemental application for the new use within 36 months or within such time as FDA has determined to be appropriate under § 99.303(a) or (b), the manufacturer has discontinued or terminated the clinical studies that would be necessary to support a supplemental application for a new use.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Effective date of orders to cease dissemination.</I> An order to cease dissemination of information shall be effective upon date of receipt by the manufacturer, unless otherwise stated in such order.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Cessation of dissemination by a noncomplying manufacturer.</I> A manufacturer that begins to disseminate information in compliance with this part, but subsequently fails to comply with this part, shall immediately cease disseminating information under this part. A manufacturer that discontinues, terminates, or fails to conduct with due diligence clinical studies that it certified it would complete under § 99.201(a)(4)(ii) shall be deemed not in compliance with this part. A manufacturer shall notify FDA immediately if it ceases dissemination under this paragraph.

<P>(a) FDA may, at any time, terminate the approval of an application for an exemption from the requirement to file a supplemental application if:
</P>
<P>(1) The application for an exemption had been deemed to be approved because the agency had not acted on the application within 60 days after its receipt by FDA;
</P>
<P>(2) The manufacturer is disseminating written information on the new use; and
</P>
<P>(3) FDA determines that it would be economically and ethically possible for the manufacturer to conduct the clinical studies needed to submit a supplemental application for the new use.
</P>
<P>(b) If FDA terminates a deemed approval of an application for an exemption under paragraph (a) of this section, FDA also may:
</P>
<P>(1) Order the manufacturer to cease disseminating information; and
</P>
<P>(2) Order the manufacturer to take action to correct the information that has been disseminated if FDA determines that the new use described in the disseminated information would pose a significant risk to public health.
</P>
<P>(c) FDA shall notify the manufacturer if it terminates the deemed approval of an application for an exemption under paragraph (a) of this section. If FDA also issues an order to cease dissemination of information, the manufacturer shall comply with the order no later than 60 days after its receipt.
</P>
<P>(d) FDA may, at any time, terminate the approval of an application for an exemption from the requirement to file a supplemental application for a new use if, after consulting with the manufacturer that was granted such exemption, FDA determines that the manufacturer no longer meets the requirements for an exemption on the basis that it is economically prohibitive or unethical to conduct the studies needed to submit a supplemental application for the new use.
</P>
<P>(e) If FDA terminates an approval of an application for an exemption under paragraph (d) of this section, the manufacturer must, within 60 days of being notified by FDA that its exemption approval has been terminated, file a supplemental application for the new use that is the subject of the information being disseminated under the exemption, certify, under § 99.201(a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(ii) that it will file a supplemental application for the new use, or cease disseminating the information on the new use.

<DIV8 N="100.1" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="2">
<HEAD>§ 100.1   Petitions requesting exemption from preemption for State or local requirements.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Scope and purpose.</I> (1) This subpart applies to the submission and consideration of petitions under section 403A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), by a State or a political subdivision of a State, requesting exemption of a State requirement from preemption under section 403A(a) of the act.
</P>
<P>(2) Section 403A(b) of the act provides that where a State requirement has been preempted under section 403A(a) of the act, the State may petition the agency for an exemption. The agency may grant the exemption, under such conditions as it may prescribe by regulation, if the agency finds that the State requirement will not cause any food to be in violation of any applicable requirement under Federal law, will not unduly burden interstate commerce, and is designed to address a particular need for information that is not met by the preemptive Federal requirement.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Definitions.</I> (1) <I>Act</I> means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321 <I>et seq.</I>).
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Agency</I> means the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Commissioner</I> means the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>State</I> means a State as defined in section 201(a)(1) of the act (which includes a territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico) or any political subdivision of a State having authority to issue food standards and food labeling regulations having force of law.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>State requirement</I> means any statute, standard, regulation, or other requirement that is issued by a State.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Prerequisites for petitions for exemption from preemption.</I> The Food and Drug Administration will consider a petition for exemption from preemption on its merits only if the petition demonstrates that:
</P>
<P>(1) The State requirement was enacted or was issued as a final rule by an authorized official of the State and is in effect or would be in effect but for the provisions of section 403A of the act.
</P>
<P>(2) The State requirement is subject to preemption under section 403A(a) of the act because of a statutory provision listed in that section or because of a Federal standard or other Federal regulation that is in effect, or that has been published as a final rule with a designated effective date, and that was issued under the authority of a statutory provision listed in that section. For the purposes of this subpart, all petitions seeking exemption from preemption under section 403A(a)(3) through (a)(5) of the act submitted before May 8, 1992, will be considered timely even though the applicable statutory provisions or regulations are not yet in effect.
</P>
<P>(3) The petitioner is an official of a State having authority to act for, or on behalf of, the Government in applying for an exemption of State requirements from preemption.
</P>
<P>(4) The State requirement is subject to preemption under section 403A(a) of the act because it is not identical to the requirement of the preemptive Federal statutory provision or regulation including a standard of identity, quality, and fill. “Not identical to” does not refer to the specific words in the requirement but instead means that the State requirement directly or indirectly imposes obligations or contains provisions concerning the composition or labeling of food, or concerning a food container, that:
</P>
<P>(i) Are not imposed by or contained in the applicable provision (including any implementing regulation) of section 401 or 403 of the act; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Differ from those specifically imposed by or contained in the applicable provision (including any implementing regulation) of section 401 or 403 of the act.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Form of petition.</I> (1) All information included in the petition should meet the general requirements of § 10.20(c) of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(2) An original and one copy of the petition shall be submitted, or the petitioner may submit an original and a computer readable disk containing the petition. Contents of the disk should be in a standard format, such as ASCII format. (Petitioners interested in submitting a disk should contact the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition for details.)
</P>
<P>(3) Petitions for exemption from preemption for a State requirement shall be submitted to the Dockets Management Staff in the following form:

<HD2>A. Action Requested
</HD2>
<P>1. Identify and give the exact wording of the State requirement and give date it was enacted or issued in final form.
</P>
<P>2. Identify the specific standard or regulation that is believed to preempt the State requirement and the section and paragraph of the act that the standard or regulation implements.
</P>
<HD2>B. Documentation of State Requirement
</HD2>

</P>
<P>1. An explanation of the State requirement and its rationale, and a comparison of State and Federal requirements to show differences.
</P>
<P>2. An explanation of why compliance with the State requirement would not cause a food to be in violation of any applicable requirement under Federal law.
</P>
<P>3. Information on the effect that granting the State petition will have on interstate commerce. The petition should contain information on economic feasibility, i.e., whether the State and Federal requirements have significantly different effects on the production and distribution of the food product; comparison of the costs of compliance as shown by data or information on the actual or anticipated effect of the State and Federal requirements on the sale and price of the food product in interstate commerce; and the effect of the State requirement on the availability of the food product to consumers. To the extent possible, the petition should include information showing that it is practical and feasible for producers of food products to comply with the State requirement. Such information may be submitted in the form of statements from affected persons indicating their ability to comply.
</P>
<P>4. Identification of a particular need for information that the State requirement is designed to meet, which need is not met by Federal law.

<HEAD>§ 100.100   Misleading containers.</HEAD>
<P>In accordance with section 403(d) of the act, a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if its container is so made, formed, or filled as to be misleading.
</P>
<P>(a) A container that does not allow the consumer to fully view its contents shall be considered to be filled as to be misleading if it contains nonfunctional slack-fill. Slack-fill is the difference between the actual capacity of a container and the volume of product contained therein. Nonfunctional slack-fill is the empty space in a package that is filled to less than its capacity for reasons other than:
</P>
<P>(1) Protection of the contents of the package;
</P>
<P>(2) The requirements of the machines used for enclosing the contents in such package;
</P>
<P>(3) Unavoidable product settling during shipping and handling;
</P>
<P>(4) The need for the package to perform a specific function (e.g., where packaging plays a role in the preparation or consumption of a food), where such function is inherent to the nature of the food and is clearly communicated to consumers;
</P>
<P>(5) The fact that the product consists of a food packaged in a reusable container where the container is part of the presentation of the food and has value which is both significant in proportion to the value of the product and independent of its function to hold the food, e.g., a gift product consisting of a food or foods combined with a container that is intended for further use after the food is consumed; or durable commemorative or promotional packages; or
</P>
<P>(6) Inability to increase level of fill or to further reduce the size of the package (e.g., where some minimum package size is necessary to accommodate required food labeling (excluding any vignettes or other nonmandatory designs or label information), discourage pilfering, facilitate handling, or accommodate tamper-resistant devices).

<HEAD>§ 101.1   Principal display panel of package form food.</HEAD>
<P>The term <I>principal display panel</I> as it applies to food in package form and as used in this part, means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display panel shall be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label information required to be placed thereon by this part with clarity and conspicuousness and without obscuring design, vignettes, or crowding. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, information required to be placed on the principal display panel shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. For the purpose of obtaining uniform type size in declaring the quantity of contents for all packages of substantially the same size, the term <I>area of the principal display panel</I> means the area of the side or surface that bears the principal display panel, which area shall be:
</P>
<P>(a) In the case of a rectangular package where one entire side properly can be considered to be the principal display panel side, the product of the height times the width of that side;
</P>
<P>(b) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container, 40 percent of the product of the height of the container times the circumference;
</P>
<P>(c) In the case of any otherwise shaped container, 40 percent of the total surface of the container: <I>Provided, however,</I> That where such container presents an obvious “principal display panel” such as the top of a triangular or circular package of cheese, the area shall consist of the entire top surface. In determining the area of the principal display panel, exclude tops, bottoms, flanges at tops and bottoms of cans, and shoulders and necks of bottles or jars. In the case of cylindrical or nearly cylindrical containers, information required by this part to appear on the principal display panel shall appear within that 40 percent of the circumference which is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale.

<HEAD>§ 101.2   Information panel of package form food.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The term <I>information panel</I> as it applies to packaged food means that part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel with the following exceptions:
</P>
<P>(1) If the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel is too small to accommodate the necessary information or is otherwise unusable label space, e.g., folded flaps or can ends, the panel immediately contiguous and to the right of this part of the label may be used.
</P>
<P>(2) If the package has one or more alternate principal display panels, the information panel is immediately contiguous and to the right of any principal display panel.
</P>
<P>(3) If the top of the container is the principal display panel and the package has no alternate principal display panel, the information panel is any panel adjacent to the principal display panel.
</P>
<P>(b) All information required to appear on the label of any package of food under §§ 101.4, 101.5, 101.8, 101.9, 101.13, 101.17, 101.36, subpart D of part 101, and part 105 of this chapter shall appear either on the principal display panel or on the information panel, unless otherwise specified by regulations in this chapter.
</P>
<P>(c) All information appearing on the principal display panel or the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear prominently and conspicuously, but in no case may the letters and/or numbers be less than one-sixteenth inch in height unless an exemption pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section is established. The requirements for conspicuousness and legibility shall include the specifications of §§ 101.7(h)(1) and (2) and 101.15.
</P>
<P>(1)(i) Soft drinks packaged in bottles manufactured before October 31, 1975 shall be exempt from the requirements prescribed by this section to the extent that information which is blown, lithographed, or formed onto the surface of the bottle is exempt from the size and placement requirements of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) Soft drinks packaged in bottles shall be exempt from the size and placement requirements prescribed by this section if all of the following conditions are met:
</P>
<P>(A) If the soft drink is packaged in a bottle bearing a paper, plastic foam jacket, or foil label, or is packaged in a nonreusable bottle bearing a label lithographed onto the surface of the bottle or is packaged in metal cans, the product shall not be exempt from any requirement of this section other than the exemptions created by § 1.24(a)(5) (ii) and (v) of this chapter and the label shall bear all required information in the specified minimum type size, except the label will not be required to bear the information required by § 101.5 if this information appears on the bottle closure or on the lid of the can in a type size not less than one-sixteenth inch in height, or if embossed on the lid of the can in a type size not less than one-eighth inch in height.
</P>
<P>(B) If the soft drink is packaged in a bottle which does not bear a paper, plastic foam jacket or foil label, or is packaged in a reusable bottle bearing a label lithographed onto the surface of the bottle:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) Neither the bottle nor the closure is required to bear nutrition labeling in compliance with § 101.9, except that any multiunit retail package in which it is contained shall bear nutrition labeling if required by § 101.9; and any vending machine in which it is contained shall bear nutrition labeling if nutrition labeling is not present on the bottle or closure, if required by § 101.9.
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) All other information pursuant to this section shall appear on the top of the bottle closure prominently and conspicuously in letters and/or numbers no less than one thirty-second inch in height, except that if the information required by § 101.5 is placed on the side of the closure in accordance with § 1.24(a)(5)(ii) of this chapter, such information shall appear in letters and/or numbers no less than one-sixteenth inch in height.
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) Upon the petition of any interested person demonstrating that the bottle closure is too small to accommodate this information, the Commissioner may by regulation establish an alternative method of disseminating such information. Information appearing on the closure shall appear in the following priority:
</P>
<P>(<I>i</I>) The statement of ingredients.
</P>
<P>(<I>ii</I>) The name and address of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor.
</P>
<P>(<I>iii</I>) The statement of identity.
</P>
<P>(2) Individual serving-size packages of food served with meals in restaurants, institutions, and on board passenger carriers, and not intended for sale at retail, are exempt from type-size requirements of this paragraph, provided:
</P>
<P>(i) The package has a total area of 3 square inches or less available to bear labeling;
</P>
<P>(ii) There is insufficient area on the package available to print all required information in a type size of 
<FR>1/16</FR> inch in height;
</P>
<P>(iii) The information required by paragraph (b) of this section appears on the label in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, except that the type size is not less than 
<FR>1/32</FR> inch in height.
</P>
<P>(d)(1) Except as provided by §§ 101.9(j)(13) and (j)(17) and 101.36(i)(2) and (i)(5), all information required to appear on the principal display panel or on the information panel under this section shall appear on the same panel unless there is insufficient space. In determining the sufficiency of the available space, except as provided by §§ 101.9(j)(17) and 101.36(i)(5), any vignettes, designs, and other nonmandatory label information shall not be considered. If there is insufficient space for all of this information to appear on a single panel, it may be divided between these two panels, except that the information required under any given section or part shall all appear on the same panel. A food whose label is required to bear the ingredient statement on the principal display panel may bear all other information specified in paragraph (b) of this section on the information panel.
</P>
<P>(2) Any food, not otherwise exempted in this section, if packaged in a container consisting of a separate lid and body, and bearing nutrition labeling pursuant to § 101.9, and if the lid qualifies for and is designed to serve as a principal display panel, shall be exempt from the placement requirements of this section in the following respects:
</P>
<P>(i) The name and place of business information required by § 101.5 shall not be required on the body of the container if this information appears on the lid in accordance with this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) The nutrition information required by § 101.9 shall not be required on the lid if this information appears on the container body in accordance with this section.
</P>
<P>(iii) The statement of ingredients required by § 101.4 shall not be required on the lid if this information appears on the container body in accordance with this section. Further, the statement of ingredients is not required on the container body if this information appears on the lid in accordance with this section.
</P>
<P>(e) All information appearing on the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear in one place without other intervening material.
</P>
<P>(f) If the label of any package of food is too small to accommodate all of the information required by §§ 101.4, 101.5, 101.8, 101.9, 101.13, 101.17, 101.36, subpart D of part 101, and part 105 of this chapter, the Commissioner may establish by regulation an acceptable alternative method of disseminating such information to the public, e.g., a type size smaller than one-sixteenth inch in height, or labeling attached to or inserted in the package or available at the point of purchase. A petition requesting such a regulation, as an amendment to this paragraph, shall be submitted under part 10 of this chapter.

<HEAD>§ 101.3   Identity labeling of food in packaged form.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear as one of its principal features a statement of the identity of the commodity.
</P>
<P>(b) Such statement of identity shall be in terms of:
</P>
<P>(1) The name now or hereafter specified in or required by any applicable Federal law or regulation; or, in the absence thereof,
</P>
<P>(2) The common or usual name of the food; or, in the absence thereof,
</P>
<P>(3) An appropriately descriptive term, or when the nature of the food is obvious, a fanciful name commonly used by the public for such food.
</P>
<P>(c) Where a food is marketed in various optional forms (whole, slices, diced, etc.), the particular form shall be considered to be a necessary part of the statement of identity and shall be declared in letters of a type size bearing a reasonable relation to the size of the letters forming the other components of the statement of identity; except that if the optional form is visible through the container or is depicted by an appropriate vignette, the particular form need not be included in the statement. This specification does not affect the required declarations of identity under definitions and standards for foods promulgated pursuant to section 401 of the act.
</P>
<P>(d) This statement of identity shall be presented in bold type on the principal display panel, shall be in a size reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on such panel, and shall be in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed.
</P>
<P>(e) Under the provisions of section 403(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if it is an imitation of another food unless its label bears, in type of uniform size and prominence, the word “imitation” and, immediately thereafter, the name of the food imitated.
</P>
<P>(1) A food shall be deemed to be an imitation and thus subject to the requirements of section 403(c) of the act if it is a substitute for and resembles another food but is nutritionally inferior to that food. 
</P>
<P>(2) A food that is a substitute for and resembles another food shall not be deemed to be an imitation provided it meets each of the following requirements:
</P>
<P>(i) It is not nutritionally inferior to the food for which it substitutes and which it resembles.
</P>
<P>(ii) Its label bears a common or usual name that complies with the provisions of § 102.5 of this chapter and that is not false or misleading, or in the absence of an existing common or usual name, an appropriately descriptive term that is not false or misleading. The label may, in addition, bear a fanciful name which is not false or misleading.
</P>
<P>(3) A food for which a common or usual name is established by regulation (e.g., in a standard of identity pursuant to section 401 of the act, in a common or usual name regulation pursuant to part 102 of this chapter, or in a regulation establishing a nutritional quality guideline pursuant to part 104 of this chapter), and which complies with all of the applicable requirements of such regulation(s), shall not be deemed to be an imitation.
</P>
<P>(4) Nutritional inferiority includes: 
</P>
<P>(i) Any reduction in the content of an essential nutrient that is present in a measurable amount, but does not include a reduction in the caloric or fat content provided the food is labeled pursuant to the provisions of § 101.9, and provided the labeling with respect to any reduction in caloric content complies with the provisions applicable to caloric content in part 105 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(ii) For the purpose of this section, a measurable amount of an essential nutrient in a food shall be considered to be 2 percent or more of the Daily Reference Value (DRV) of protein listed under § 101.9(c)(7)(iii) and of potassium listed under § 101.9(c)(9) per reference amount customarily consumed and 2 percent or more of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) of any vitamin or mineral listed under § 101.9(c)(8)(iv) per reference amount customarily consumed, except that selenium, molybdenum, chromium, and chloride need not be considered.
</P>
<P>(iii) If the Commissioner concludes that a food is a substitute for and resembles another food but is inferior to the food imitated for reasons other than those set forth in this paragraph, he may propose appropriate revisions to this regulation or he may propose a separate regulation governing the particular food.

<P>(f) A label may be required to bear the percentage(s) of a characterizing ingredient(s) or information concerning the presence or absence of an ingredient(s) or the need to add an ingredient(s) as part of the common or usual name of the food pursuant to subpart B of part 102 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(g) Dietary supplements shall be identified by the term “dietary supplement” as a part of the statement of identity, except that the word “dietary” may be deleted and replaced by the name of the dietary ingredients in the product (e.g., calcium supplement) or an appropriately descriptive term indicating the type of dietary ingredients that are in the product (e.g., herbal supplement with vitamins).

For products that are blends of fats and/or oils and for foods in which fats and/or oils constitute the predominant ingredient, i.e., in which the combined weight of all fat and/or oil ingredients equals or exceeds the weight of the most predominant ingredient that is not a fat or oil, the listing of the common or usual names of such fats and/or oils in parentheses shall be in descending order of predominance. In all other foods in which a blend of fats and/or oils is used as an ingredient, the listing of the common or usual names in parentheses need not be in descending order of predominance if the manufacturer, because of the use of varying mixtures, is unable to adhere to a constant pattern of fats and/or oils in the product.

Fat and/or oil ingredients not present in the product may be listed if they may sometimes be used in the product. Such ingredients shall be identified by words indicating that they may not be present, such as “or”, “and/or”, “contains one or more of the following:”, e.g., “vegetable oil shortening (contains one or more of the following: cottonseed oil, palm oil, soybean oil)”. No fat or oil ingredient shall be listed unless actually present if the fats and/or oils constitute the predominant ingredient of the product, as defined in this paragraph (b)(14).

<HEAD>§ 101.5   Food; name and place of business of manufacturer, packer, or distributor.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The label of a food in packaged form shall specify conspicuously the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor.
</P>
<P>(b) The requirement for declaration of the name of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor shall be deemed to be satisfied, in the case of a corporation, only by the actual corporate name, which may be preceded or followed by the name of the particular division of the corporation. In the case of an individual, partnership, or association, the name under which the business is conducted shall be used.
</P>
<P>(c) Where the food is not manufactured by the person whose name appears on the label, the name shall be qualified by a phrase that reveals the connection such person has with such food; such as “Manufactured for ______”, “Distributed by ______”, or any other wording that expresses the facts.
</P>
<P>(d) The statement of the place of business shall include the street address, city, State, and ZIP code; however, the street address may be omitted if it is shown in a current city directory or telephone directory. The requirement for inclusion of the ZIP code shall apply only to consumer commodity labels developed or revised after the effective date of this section. In the case of nonconsumer packages, the ZIP code shall appear either on the label or the labeling (including invoice).

<HEAD>§ 101.7   Declaration of net quantity of contents.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear a declaration of the net quantity of contents. This shall be expressed in the terms of weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination of numerical count and weight or measure. The statement shall be in terms of fluid measure if the food is liquid, or in terms of weight if the food is solid, semisolid, or viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid; except that such statement may be in terms of dry measure if the food is a fresh fruit, fresh vegetable, or other dry commodity that is customarily sold by dry measure. If there is a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of declaring the contents of a liquid by weight, or a solid, semisolid, or viscous product by fluid measure, it may be used. Whenever the Commissioner determines that an existing practice of declaring net quantity of contents by weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination in the case of a specific packaged food does not facilitate value comparisons by consumers and offers opportunity for consumer confusion, he will by regulation designate the appropriate term or terms to be used for such commodity.
</P>
<P>(b)(1) Statements of weight shall be in terms of avoirdupois pound and ounce.
</P>
<P>(2) Statements of fluid measure shall be in terms of the U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, and fluid ounce subdivisions thereof, and shall:
</P>
<P>(i) In the case of frozen food that is sold and consumed in a frozen state, express the volume at the frozen temperature.
</P>
<P>(ii) In the case of refrigerated food that is sold in the refrigerated state, express the volume at 40 °F (4 °C).
</P>
<P>(iii) In the case of other foods, express the volume at 68 °F (20 °C).
</P>
<P>(3) Statements of dry measure shall be in terms of the U.S. bushel of 2,150.42 cubic inches and peck, dry quart, and dry pint subdivisions thereof.
</P>
<P>(c) When the declaration of quantity of contents by numerical count does not give adequate information as to the quantity of food in the package, it shall be combined with such statement of weight, measure, or size of the individual units of the foods as will provide such information.
</P>
<P>(d) The declaration may contain common or decimal fractions. A common fraction shall be in terms of halves, quarters, eighths, sixteenths, or thirty-seconds; except that if there exists a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of employing different common fractions in the net quantity declaration of a particular commodity, they may be employed. A common fraction shall be reduced to its lowest terms; a decimal fraction shall not be carried out to more than two places. A statement that includes small fractions of an ounce shall be deemed to permit smaller variations than one which does not include such fractions.
</P>
<P>(e) The declaration shall be located on the principal display panel of the label, and with respect to packages bearing alternate principal panels it shall be duplicated on each principal display panel.
</P>
<P>(f) The declaration shall appear as a distinct item on the principal display panel, shall be separated (by at least a space equal to the height of the lettering used in the declaration) from other printed label information appearing above or below the declaration and (by at least a space equal to twice the width of the letter “N” of the style of type used in the quantity of contents statement) from other printed label information appearing to the left or right of the declaration. It shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count (such as “jumbo quart” and “full gallon”) that tends to exaggerate the amount of the food in the container. It shall be placed on the principal display panel within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed: <I>Provided,</I> That on packages having a principal display panel of 5 square inches or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel shall not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of this part.
</P>
<P>(g) The declaration shall accurately reveal the quantity of food in the package exclusive of wrappers and other material packed therewith: <I>Provided,</I> That in the case of foods packed in containers designed to deliver the food under pressure, the declaration shall state the net quantity of the contents that will be expelled when the instructions for use as shown on the container are followed. The propellant is included in the net quantity declaration.
</P>
<P>(h) The declaration shall appear in conspicuous and easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast (by typography, layout, color, embossing, or molding) to other matter on the package; except that a declaration of net quantity blown, embossed, or molded on a glass or plastic surface is permissible when all label information is so formed on the surface. Requirements of conspicuousness and legibility shall include the specifications that:
</P>
<P>(1) The ratio of height to width (of the letter) shall not exceed a differential of 3 units to 1 unit (no more than 3 times as high as it is wide).
</P>
<P>(2) Letter heights pertain to upper case or capital letters. When upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower case letter “o” or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum standards.
</P>
<P>(3) When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one-half the minimum height standards.
</P>
<P>(i) The declaration shall be in letters and numerals in a type size established in relationship to the area of the principal display panel of the package and shall be uniform for all packages of substantially the same size by complying with the following type specifications:
</P>
<P>(1) Not less than one-sixteenth inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of 5 square inches or less.
</P>
<P>(2) Not less than one-eighth inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 5 but not more than 25 square inches.
</P>
<P>(3) Not less than three-sixteenths inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 25 but not more than 100 square inches.
</P>
<P>(4) Not less than one-fourth inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 100 square inches, except not less than 
<FR>1/2</FR> inch in height if the area is more than 400 square inches.
</P>
<FP>Where the declaration is blown, embossed, or molded on a glass or plastic surface rather than by printing, typing, or coloring, the lettering sizes specified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (4) of this section shall be increased by one-sixteenth of an inch.
</FP>
<P>(j) On packages containing less than 4 pounds or 1 gallon and labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure:
</P>
<P>(1) The declaration shall be expressed both in ounces, with identification by weight or by liquid measure and, if applicable (1 pound or 1 pint or more) followed in parentheses by a declaration in pounds for weight units, with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pound (see examples set forth in paragraphs (m) (1) and (2) of this section), or in the case of liquid measure, in the largest whole units (quarts, quarts and pints, or pints, as appropriate) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart (see examples in paragraphs (m) (3) and (4) of this section).
</P>
<P>(2) If the net quantity of contents declaration appears on a random package, that is a package which is one of a lot, shipment, or delivery of packages of the same consumer commodity with varying weights and with no fixed weight pattern, it may, when the net weight exceeds 1 pound, be expressed in terms of pounds and decimal fractions of the pound carried out to not more than two decimal places. When the net weight does not exceed 1 pound, the declaration on the random package may be in decimal fractions of the pound in lieu of ounces (see example in paragraph (m)(5) of this section).
</P>
<P>(3) The declaration may appear in more than one line. The term “net weight” shall be used when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of weight. Use of the terms “net” or “net contents” in terms of fluid measure or numerical count is optional. It is sufficient to distinguish avoirdupois ounce from fluid ounce through association of terms; for example, “Net wt. 6 oz” or “6 oz Net wt.” and “6 fl oz” or “Net contents 6 fl oz”.
</P>
<P>(k) On packages containing 4 pounds or 1 gallon or more and labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure, the declaration shall be expressed in pounds for weight units with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fraction of the pound, or in the case of fluid measure, it shall be expressed in the largest whole unit (gallons followed by common or decimal fraction of a gallon or by the next smaller whole unit or units (quarts, or quarts and pints)) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart (see paragraph (m)(6) of this section).
</P>
<P>(l) [Reserved]
</P>
<P>(m) Examples:
</P>
<P>(1) A declaration of 1
<FR>1/2</FR> pounds weight shall be expressed as “Net Wt. 24 oz (1 lb 8 oz),” “Net Wt. 24 oz (1
<FR>1/2</FR> lb),” or “Net Wt. 24 oz (1.5 lb)”.
</P>
<P>(2) A declaration of three-fourths pound avoirdupois weight shall be expressed as “Net Wt. 12 oz”.
</P>
<P>(3) A declaration of 1 quart liquid measure shall be expressed as “Net 32 fl oz (1 qt)”.
</P>
<P>(4) A declaration of 1
<FR>3/4</FR> quarts liquid measure shall be expressed as “Net contents 56 fluid ounces (1 quart 1
<FR>1/2</FR> pints)” or as “Net 56 fluid oz (1 qt 1 pt 8 oz)”, but not in terms of quart and ounce such as “Net 56 fluid oz (1 quart 24 ounces)”.
</P>
<P>(5) On a random package, declaration of three-fourths pound avoirdupois may be expressed as “Net Wt. .75 lb”.
</P>
<P>(6) A declaration of 2
<FR>1/2</FR> gallons liquid measure shall be expressed as “Net contents 2
<FR>1/2</FR> gallons,” “Net contents 2.5 gallons,” or “Net contents 2 gallons 2 quarts” and not as “2 gallons 4 pints”.
</P>
<P>(n) For quantities, the following abbreviations and none other may be employed (periods and plural forms are optional):
</P>
<EXTRACT>
<SCOL2>
<LI>weight wt</LI>
<LI>ounce oz</LI>
<LI>pound lb</LI>
<LI>gallon gal</LI>
<LI>pint pt</LI>
<LI>quart qt</LI>
<LI>fluid fl</LI></SCOL2></EXTRACT>
<P>(o) Nothing in this section shall prohibit supplemental statements at locations other than the principal display panel(s) describing in nondeceptive terms the net quantity of contents; <I>Provided,</I> that such supplemental statements of net quantity of contents shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count that tends to exaggerate the amount of the food contained in the package; for example, “jumbo quart” and “full gallon”. Dual or combination declarations of net quantity of contents as provided for in paragraphs (a), (c), and (j) of this section (for example, a combination of net weight plus numerical count, net contents plus dilution directions of a concentrate, etc.) are not regarded as supplemental net quantity statements and may be located on the principal display panel.
</P>
<P>(p) A separate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the metric system is not regarded as a supplemental statement and an accurate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the metric system of weight or measure may also appear on the principal display panel or on other panels.
</P>
<P>(q) The declaration of net quantity of contents shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the package. Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the course of good distribution practice or by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practice will be recognized. Variations from stated quantity of contents shall not be unreasonably large.
</P>
<P>(r) The declaration of net quantity of contents on pickles and pickle products, including relishes but excluding one or two whole pickles in clear plastic bags which may be declared by count, shall be expressed in terms of the U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, and fluid ounce subdivisions thereof.
</P>
<P>(s) On a multiunit retail package, a statement of the quantity of contents shall appear on the outside of the package and shall include the number of individual units, the quantity of each individual unit, and, in parentheses, the total quantity of contents of the multiunit package in terms of avoirdupois or fluid ounces, except that such declaration of total quantity need not be followed by an additional parenthetical declaration in terms of the largest whole units and subdivisions thereof, as required by paragraph (j)(1) of this section. A multiunit retail package may thus be properly labeled: “6-16 oz bottles—(96 fl oz)” or “3-16 oz cans—(net wt. 48 oz)”. For the purposes of this section, “multiunit retail package” means a package containing two or more individually packaged units of the identical commodity and in the same quantity, intended to be sold as part of the multiunit retail package but capable of being individually sold in full compliance with all requirements of the regulations in this part. Open multiunit retail packages that do not obscure the number of units or prevent examination of the labeling on each of the individual units are not subject to this paragraph if the labeling of each individual unit complies with the requirements of paragraphs (f) and (i) of this section. The provisions of this section do not apply to that butter or margarine covered by the exemptions in § 1.24(a) (10) and (11) of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(t) Where the declaration of net quantity of contents is in terms of net weight and/or drained weight or volume and does not accurately reflect the actual quantity of the contents or the product falls below the applicable standard of fill of container because of equipment malfunction or otherwise unintentional product variation, and the label conforms in all other respects to the requirements of this chapter (except the requirement that food falling below the applicable standard of fill of container shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter), the mislabeled food product, including any food product that fails to bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter, may be sold by the manufacturer or processor directly to institutions operated by Federal, State or local governments (schools, prisons, hospitals, etc.): <I>Provided,</I> That:
</P>
<P>(1) The purchaser shall sign a statement at the time of sale stating that he is aware that the product is mislabeled to include acknowledgment of the nature and extent of the mislabeling, (e.g., “Actual net weight may be as low as __% below labeled quantity”) and that any subsequent distribution by him of said product except for his own institutional use is unlawful. This statement shall be kept on file at the principal place of business of the manufacturer or processor for 2 years subsequent to the date of shipment of the product and shall be available to the Food and Drug Administration upon request.
</P>
<P>(2) The product shall be labeled on the outside of its shipping container with the statement(s):
</P>
<P>(i) When the variation concerns net weight and/or drained weight or volume, “Product Mislabeled. Actual net weight (drained weight or volume where appropriate) may be as low as __% below labeled quantity. This Product Not for Retail Distribution”, the blank to be filled in with the maximum percentage variance between the labeled and actual weight or volume of contents of the individual packages in the shipping container, and
</P>
<P>(ii) When the variation is in regard to a fill of container standard, “Product Mislabeled. Actual fill may be as low as __% below standard of fill. This Product Not for Retail Distribution”.
</P>
<P>(3) The statements required by paragraphs (t)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, which may be consolidated where appropriate, shall appear prominently and conspicuously as compared to other printed matter on the shipping container and in boldface print or type on a clear, contrasting background in order to render them likely to be read and understood by the purchaser under ordinary conditions of purchase.

Smaller formats allowed for Nutrition Facts for certain food labeling under FDA regulation at § 101.9 are not considered to be a size that a prospective purchaser is able to easily read; or
</P>
<P>(ii) The calories, serving size, and servings per container listed in a reproduction of the Nutrition Facts label on the vending machine food, provided that the reproduction is a reproduction of an actual Nutrition Facts label that complies with § 101.9 for a vending machine food, is presented in a size that permits the prospective purchaser to be able to easily read the nutrition information, and the calories, serving size, and servings per container are displayed by the vending machine before the prospective purchaser makes his or her purchase; or
</P>
<P>(2) The prospective purchaser can otherwise view visible nutrition information, including, at a minimum, the total number of calories for the article of food as sold at the point of purchase. This visible nutrition information must appear on the food label itself. The visible nutrition information must be clear and conspicuous and able to be easily read on the article of food while in the vending machine, in a type size at least 150 percent of the size required by § 101.7(i) for the net quantity of contents declaration on the front of the package, and with sufficient color and contrasting background to other print on the label to permit the prospective purchaser to clearly distinguish the information.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Requirements for calorie labeling for certain food sold from vending machines</I>—(1) <I>Applicability; covered vending machine food.</I> For the purposes of this section, the term “covered vending machine food” means an article of food that is:
</P>
<P>(i) Sold from a vending machine that does not permit the prospective purchaser to examine the Nutrition Facts label prior to purchase as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or otherwise provide visible nutrition information at the point of purchase as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Sold from a vending machine that:
</P>
<P>(A) Is operated by a person engaged in the business of owning or operating 20 or more vending machines; or
</P>
<P>(B) Is operated by a vending machine operator that has voluntarily elected to be subject to the requirements of this section by registering with FDA under paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Calorie declaration.</I> (i) The number of calories for a covered vending machine food must be declared in the following manner:
</P>
<P>(A) To the nearest 5-calorie increment up to and including 50 calories and 10-calorie increment above 50 calories, except that amounts less than 5 calories may be expressed as zero.
</P>
<P>(B) The term “Calories” or “Cal” must appear adjacent to the caloric content value for each food in the vending machine.
</P>
<P>(C) The calorie declaration for a packaged food must include the total calories present in the packaged food, regardless of whether the packaged food contains a single serving or multiple servings. The vending machine operator may voluntarily disclose calories per serving in addition to the total calories for the food.
</P>
<P>(D) If a covered vending machine food is one where the prospective purchaser selects among options to produce a final vended product (<I>e.g.,</I> vended coffee, hot chocolate or tea with options for added sugar, sugar substitute, milk, and cream), calories must be declared per option or for the final vended products.
</P>
<P>(ii) Calorie declarations for covered vending machine food must be clear and conspicuous and placed prominently in the following manner:
</P>
<P>(A) The calorie declarations may be placed on a sign in close proximity to the article of food or selection button, <I>i.e.,</I> in, on, or adjacent to the vending machine, but not necessarily attached to the vending machine, so long as the calorie declaration is visible at the same time as the food, its name, price, selection button, or selection number is visible. The sign must give calorie declarations for those articles of food that are sold from that particular vending machine.
</P>
<P>(B) When the calorie declaration is in or on the vending machine, the calorie declaration must be in a type size no smaller than the name of the food on the machine (not the label), selection number, or price of the food as displayed on the vending machine, whichever is smallest, with the same prominence, <I>i.e.,</I> the same color, or in a color at least as conspicuous, as the color of the name, if applicable, or price of the food or selection number, and the same contrasting background, or a background at least as contrasting as the background used for the item it is in closest proximity to, <I>i.e.,</I> name, selection number, or price of the food item as displayed on the machine.
</P>
<P>(C) When the calorie declaration is on a sign adjacent to the vending machine, the calorie declaration must be in a type size large enough to render it likely to be read and understood by the prospective purchaser under customary conditions of purchase and use, and in a type that is all black or one color on a white or other neutral background that contrasts with the type color.
</P>
<P>(D) Where the vending machine only displays a picture or other representation or name of the food item, the calorie declaration must be in close proximity to the picture or other representation or name, or in close proximity to the selection button.
</P>
<P>(E) For electronic vending machines (<I>e.g.,</I> machines with digital or electronic or liquid crystal display (LCD) displays), the calorie declaration must be displayed before the prospective purchaser makes his or her purchase.
</P>
<P>(F) For vending machines with few choices, <I>e.g.,</I> popcorn, the calorie declaration may appear on the face of the machine so long as the declaration is prominent, not crowded by other labeling on the machine, and the type size is no smaller than the name of the food on the machine (not the label), selection number, or price of the food as displayed on the vending machine, whichever is smallest.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Voluntary provision of calorie labeling for foods sold from vending machines</I>—(1) <I>Applicability.</I> A vending machine operator that is not subject to the requirements of section 403(q)(5)(H)(viii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act may, through its authorized official, voluntarily register with FDA to be subject to the requirements established in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. An authorized official of a vending machine operator that voluntarily registers cannot be subject to any State or local nutrition labeling requirements that are not identical to the requirements in 403(q)(5)(H) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

<HEAD>§ 101.9   Nutrition labeling of food.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Nutrition information relating to food shall be provided for all products intended for human consumption and offered for sale unless an exemption is provided for the product in paragraph (j) of this section.
</P>
<P>(1) When food is in package form, the required nutrition labeling information shall appear on the label in the format specified in this section.
</P>
<P>(2) When food is not in package form, the required nutrition labeling information shall be displayed clearly at the point of purchase (e.g., on a counter card, sign, tag affixed to the product, or some other appropriate device). Alternatively, the required information may be placed in a booklet, looseleaf binder, or other appropriate format that is available at the point of purchase.
</P>
<P>(3) Solicitation of requests for nutrition information by a statement “For nutrition information write to ______________________ ” on the label or in the labeling or advertising for a food, or providing such information in a direct written reply to a solicited or unsolicited request, does not subject the label or the labeling of a food exempted under paragraph (j) of this section to the requirements of this section if the reply to the request conforms to the requirements of this section.
</P>
<P>(4) If any vitamin or mineral is added to a food so that a single serving provides 50 percent or more of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for the age group for which the product is intended, as specified in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section, of any one of the added vitamins or minerals, unless such addition is permitted or required in other regulations, e.g., a standard of identity or nutritional quality guideline, or is otherwise exempted by the Commissioner, the food shall be considered a food for special dietary use within the meaning of § 105.3(a)(1)(iii) of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(b) Except as provided in § 101.9(h)(3), all nutrient and food component quantities shall be declared in relation to a serving as defined in this section.
</P>
<P>(1) The term <I>serving</I> or <I>serving size</I> means an amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons 4 years of age or older which is expressed in a common household measure that is appropriate to the food. When the food is specially formulated or processed for use by infants or by toddlers, a serving or serving size means an amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively.
</P>
<P>(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(6) of this section and for products that are intended for weight control and are available only through a weight-control or weight-maintenance program, serving size declared on a product label shall be determined from the “Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed Per Eating Occasion * * * *” (reference amounts) that appear in § 101.12(b) using the procedures described below. For products that are both intended for weight control and available only through a weight-control program, a manufacturer may determine the serving size that is consistent with the meal plan of the program. Such products must bear a statement, “for sale only through the ______ program” (fill in the blank with the name of the appropriate weight-control program, e.g., Smith's Weight Control), on the principal display panel. However, the reference amounts in § 101.12(b) shall be used for purposes of evaluating whether weight-control products that are available only through a weight-control program qualify for nutrient content claims or health claims.
</P>
<P>(i) For products in discrete units (e.g., muffins, sliced products, such as sliced bread, or individually packaged products within a multiserving package) and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is in discrete units (e.g., pancakes and syrup), the serving size shall be declared as follows:
</P>
<P>(A) If a unit weighs 50 percent or less of the reference amount, the serving size shall be the number of whole units that most closely approximates the reference amount for the product category;
</P>
<P>(B) If a unit weighs more than 50 percent, but less than 67 percent of the reference amount, the manufacturer may declare one unit or two units as the serving size;
</P>
<P>(C) If a unit weighs 67 percent or more, but less than 200 percent of the reference amount, the serving size shall be one unit;
</P>
<P>(D) If a unit weighs at least 200 percent and up to and including 300 percent of the applicable reference amount, the serving size shall be the amount that approximates the reference amount. In addition to providing a column within the Nutrition Facts label that lists the quantitative amounts and percent Daily Values per serving size, the manufacturer shall provide a column within the Nutrition Facts label that lists the quantitative amounts and percent Daily Values per individual unit. The first column would be based on the serving size for the product and the second column would be based on the individual unit. The exemptions in paragraphs (b)(12)(i)(A), (B), and (C) of this section apply to this provision.
</P>
<P>(E) The serving size for maraschino cherries shall be expressed as 1 cherry with the parenthetical metric measure equal to the average weight of a medium size cherry.
</P>
<P>(F) The serving size for products that naturally vary in size (e.g., pickles, shellfish, whole fish, and fillet of fish) may be the amount in ounces that most closely approximates the reference amount for the product category. Manufacturers shall adhere to the requirements in paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this section for expressing the serving size in ounces.
</P>
<P>(G) For products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is in discrete units (e.g., pancakes and syrup), the serving size may be the number of discrete units represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the reference amount for the combined product determined in § 101.12(f).
</P>
<P>(H) For packages containing several individual single-serving containers, each of which is labeled with all required information including nutrition labeling as specified in § 101.9 (that is, are labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers), the serving size shall be 1 unit.
</P>
<P>(ii) For products in large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., cake, pie, pizza, melon, cabbage), for unprepared products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., cake mix, pizza kit), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a large discrete unit usually divided for consumption (e.g., prepared cake packaged with a can of frosting), the serving size shall be the fractional slice of the ready-to-eat product (e.g., 
<FR>1/12</FR> cake, 
<FR>1/8</FR> pie, 
<FR>1/4</FR> pizza, 
<FR>1/4</FR> melon, 
<FR>1/6</FR> cabbage) that most closely approximates the reference amount for the product category, and may be the fraction of the package used to make the reference amount for the unprepared product determined in § 101.12(c) or the fraction of the large discrete unit represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the reference amount for the combined product determined in § 101.12(f). In expressing the fractional slice, manufacturers shall use 
<FR>1/2</FR>, 
<FR>1/3</FR>, 
<FR>1/4</FR>, 
<FR>1/5</FR>, 
<FR>1/6</FR>, or smaller fractions that can be generated by further division by 2 or 3.
</P>
<P>(iii) For nondiscrete bulk products (e.g., breakfast cereal, flour, sugar, dry mixes, concentrates, pancake mixes, macaroni and cheese kits), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a bulk product (e.g., peanut butter and jelly), the serving size shall be the amount in household measure that most closely approximates the reference amount for the product category and may be the amount of the bulk product represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the reference amount for the combined product determined in § 101.12(f).
</P>
<P>(3) The serving size for meal products and main dish products as defined in § 101.13 (l) and (m) that comes in single-serving containers as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section shall be the entire content (edible portion only) of the package. Serving size for meal products and main dish products in multiserving containers shall be based on the reference amount applicable to the product in § 101.12(b) if the product is listed in § 101.12(b). Serving size for meal products and main dish products in multiserving containers that are not listed in § 101.12(b) shall be based on the reference amount according to § 101.12(f).
</P>
<P>(4) A variety pack, such as a package containing several varieties of single-serving units as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and a product having two or more compartments with each compartment containing a different food, shall provide nutrition information for each variety or food per serving size that is derived from the reference amount in § 101.12(b) applicable for each variety or food and the procedures to convert the reference amount to serving size in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
</P>
<P>(5) For labeling purposes, the term <I>common household measure</I> or <I>common household unit</I> means cup, tablespoon, teaspoon, piece, slice, fraction (e.g., 
<FR>1/4</FR> pizza), ounce (oz), fluid ounce (fl oz), or other common household equipment used to package food products (e.g., jar, tray). In expressing serving size in household measures, except as specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(iv), (b)(5)(v), (b)(5)(vi), and (b)(5)(vii) of this section, the following rules shall be used:
</P>
<P>(i) Cups, tablespoons, or teaspoons shall be used wherever possible and appropriate except for beverages. For beverages, a manufacturer may use fluid ounces. Cups shall be expressed in 1/4- or 1/3-cup increments. Tablespoons shall be expressed as 1, 1 1/3, 1 1/2, 1 2/3, 2, or 3 tablespoons. Teaspoons shall be expressed as 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1, or 2 teaspoons.
</P>
<P>(ii) If cups, tablespoons or teaspoons are not applicable, units such as piece, slice, tray, jar, and fraction shall be used.
</P>
<P>(iii) If paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(5)(ii) of this section are not applicable, ounces may be used with an appropriate visual unit of measure such as a dimension of a piece, e.g., 1 oz (28 g/about 
<FR>1/2</FR> pickle). Ounce measurements shall be expressed in 0.5 oz increments most closely approximating the reference amount.
</P>
<P>(iv) A description of the individual container or package shall be used for single serving containers and for individually packaged products within multiserving containers (e.g., can, box, package). A description of the individual unit shall be used for other products in discrete units (e.g., piece, slice, cracker, bar).
</P>
<P>(v) For unprepared products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., cake mix, pizza kit), the fraction or portion of the package may be used.
</P>
<P>(vi) Ounces with an appropriate visual unit of measure, as described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, may be used for products that naturally vary in size as provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(F) of this section.
</P>
<P>(vii) As provided for in § 101.9(h)(1), for products that consist of two or more distinct ingredients or components packaged and presented to be consumed together (e.g. dry macaroni and cheese mix, cake and muffin mixes with separate ingredient packages, pancakes and syrup), nutrition information may be declared for each component or as a composite. The serving size may be provided in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), and (b)(2)(iii) of this section, or alternatively in ounces with an appropriate visual unit of measure, as described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section (e.g., declared as separate components: “3 oz dry macaroni (84 g/about 
<FR>2/3</FR> cup)” and “1 oz dry cheese mix (28 g/about 2 tbsp);” declared as a composite value: “4 oz (112 g/about 
<FR>2/3</FR> cup macaroni and 2 tbsp dry cheese mix)”).
</P>
<P>(viii) For nutrition labeling purposes, a teaspoon means 5 milliliters (mL), a tablespoon means 15 mL, a cup means 240 mL, 1 fl oz means 30 mL, and 1 oz in weight means 28 g.
</P>
<P>(ix) When a serving size, determined from the reference amount in § 101.12(b) and the procedures described in this section, falls exactly half way between two serving sizes, e.g., 2.5 tbsp, manufacturers shall round the serving size up to the next incremental size.
</P>
<P>(6) A product that is packaged and sold individually that contains less than 200 percent of the applicable reference amount must be considered to be a single-serving container, and the entire content of the product must be labeled as one serving. In addition to providing a column within the Nutrition Facts label that lists the quantitative amounts and percent Daily Values per serving, for a product that is packaged and sold individually that contains more than 150 percent and less than 200 percent of the applicable reference amount, the Nutrition Facts label may voluntarily provide, to the left of the column that provides nutrition information per container (<I>i.e.,</I> per serving), an additional column that lists the quantitative amounts and percent Daily Values per common household measure that most closely approximates the reference amount.
</P>
<P>(7) A label statement regarding a serving shall be the serving size expressed in common household measures as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(6) of this section and shall be followed by the equivalent metric quantity in parenthesis (fluids in milliliters and all other foods in grams) except for single-serving containers.
</P>
<P>(i) For a single-serving container, the parenthetical metric quantity, which will be presented as part of the net weight statement on the principal display panel, is not required except where nutrition information is required on a drained weight basis according to § 101.9(b)(9). However, if a manufacturer voluntarily provides the metric quantity on products that can be sold as single servings, then the numerical value provided as part of the serving size declaration must be identical to the metric quantity declaration provided as part of the net quantity of contents statement.
</P>
<P>(ii) The gram or milliliter quantity equivalent to the household measure should be rounded to the nearest whole number except for quantities that are less than 5 g (mL). The gram (mL) quantity between 2 and 5 g (mL) should be rounded to the nearest 0.5 g (mL) and the g (mL) quantity less than 2 g (mL) should be expressed in 0.1-g (mL) increments.
</P>
<P>(iii) In addition, serving size may be declared in ounce and fluid ounce, in parenthesis, following the metric measure separated by a slash where other common household measures are used as the primary unit for serving size, e.g., 1 slice (28 g/1 oz) for sliced bread. The ounce quantity equivalent to the metric quantity should be expressed in 0.1 oz increments.
</P>
<P>(iv) If a manufacturer elects to use abbreviations for units, the following abbreviations shall be used: tbsp for tablespoon, tsp for teaspoon, g for gram, mL for milliliter, oz for ounce, and fl oz for fluid ounce.
</P>
<P>(v) For products that only require the addition of water or another ingredient that contains insignificant amounts of nutrients in the amount added and that are prepared in such a way that there are no significant changes to the nutrient profile, the amount of the finished product may be declared in parentheses at the end of the serving size declaration (e.g., 
<FR>1/2</FR> cup (120 mL) concentrated soup (makes 1 cup prepared)).
</P>
<P>(vi) To promote uniformity in label serving sizes in household measures declared by different manufacturers, FDA has provided a guidance document entitled, “Guidelines for Determining the Gram Weight of the Household Measure.” The guidance document can be obtained from the Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling (HFS-800), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740.
</P>
<P>(8) Determination of the number of servings per container shall be based on the serving size of the product determined by following the procedures described in this section.
</P>
<P>(i) The number of servings shall be rounded to the nearest whole number except for the number of servings between 2 and 5 servings and random weight products. The number of servings between 2 and 5 servings shall be rounded to the nearest 0.5 serving. Rounding should be indicated by the use of the term <I>about</I> (e.g., about 2 servings, about 3.5 servings).
</P>
<P>(ii) When the serving size is required to be expressed on a drained solids basis and the number of servings varies because of a natural variation in unit size (e.g., maraschino cherries, pickles), the manufacturer may state the typical number of servings per container (e.g., usually 5 servings).
</P>
<P>(iii) For random weight products, manufacturers may declare “varied” for the number of servings per container provided the nutrition information is based on the reference amount expressed in the appropriate household measure based on the hierarchy described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Random weight products are foods such as cheeses that are sold as random weights that vary in size, such that the net contents for different containers would vary. The manufacturer may provide the typical number of servings in parentheses following the “varied” statement.
</P>
<P>(iv) For packages containing several individual single-serving containers, each of which is labeled with all required information including nutrition labeling as specified in § 101.9 (that is, are labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers), the number of servings shall be the number of individual packages within the total package.
</P>
<P>(v) For packages containing several individually packaged multiserving units, the number of servings shall be determined by multiplying the number of individual multiserving units in the total package by the number of servings in each individual unit.
</P>
<P>(9) The declaration of nutrient and food component content shall be on the basis of food as packaged or purchased with the exception of raw fish covered under § 101.42 (see 101.44), packaged single-ingredient products that consist of fish or game meat as provided for in paragraph (j)(11) of this section, and of foods that are packed or canned in water, brine, or oil but whose liquid packing medium is not customarily consumed (e.g., canned fish, maraschino cherries, pickled fruits, and pickled vegetables). Declaration of nutrient and food component content of raw fish shall follow the provisions in § 101.45. Declaration of the nutrient and food component content of foods that are packed in liquid which is not customarily consumed shall be based on the drained solids.
</P>
<P>(10) Another column of figures may be used to declare the nutrient and food component information:
</P>
<P>(i) Per 100 g or 100 mL, or per 1 oz or 1 fl oz of the food as packaged or purchased;
</P>
<P>(ii) Per one unit if the serving size of a product in discrete units is more than 1 unit.
</P>
<P>(iii) Per cup popped for popcorn in a multiserving container.
</P>
<P>(11) If a product is promoted on the label, labeling, or advertising for a use that differs in quantity by twofold or greater from the use upon which the reference amount in § 101.12(b) was based (e.g., liquid cream substitutes promoted for use with breakfast cereals), the manufacturer shall provide a second column of nutrition information based on the amount customarily consumed in the promoted use, in addition to the nutrition information per serving derived from the reference amount in § 101.12(b), except that nondiscrete bulk products that are used primarily as ingredients (e.g., flour, sweeteners, shortenings, oils), or traditionally used for multipurposes (e.g., eggs, butter, margarine), and multipurpose baking mixes are exempt from this requirement.
</P>
<P>(12)(i) Products that are packaged and sold individually and that contain at least 200 percent and up to and including 300 percent of the applicable reference amount must provide an additional column within the Nutrition Facts label that lists the quantitative amounts and percent Daily Values for the entire package, as well as a column listing the quantitative amounts and percent Daily Values for a serving that is less than the entire package (<I>i.e.,</I> the serving size derived from the reference amount). The first column would be based on the serving size for the product and the second column would be based on the entire contents of the package.
</P>
<P>(A) This provision does not apply to products that meet the requirements to use the tabular format in paragraph (j)(13)(ii)(A)(<I>1</I>) of this section or to products that meet the requirements to use the linear format in paragraph (j)(13)(ii)(A)(<I>2</I>) of this section.
</P>

<P>(7) “Protein”: A statement of the number of grams of protein in a serving, expressed to the nearest gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, the statement “Contains less than 1 gram” or “less than 1 gram” may be used as an alternative, and if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content may be expressed as zero. When the protein in foods represented or purported to be for adults and children 4 or more years of age has a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of less than 20 expressed as a percent, or when the protein in a food represented or purported to be for children greater than 1 but less than 4 years of age has a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of less than 40 expressed as a percent, either of the following shall be placed adjacent to the declaration of protein content by weight: The statement “not a significant source of protein,” or a listing aligned under the column headed “Percent Daily Value” of the corrected amount of protein per serving, as determined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, calculated as a percentage of the Daily Reference Value (DRV) or Reference Daily Intake (RDI), as appropriate, for protein and expressed as a Percent of Daily Value. When the protein quality in a food as measured by the Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) is less than 40 percent of the reference standard (casein) for a food represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months, the statement “not a significant source of protein” shall be placed adjacent to the declaration of protein content. Protein content may be calculated on the basis of the factor 6.25 times the nitrogen content of the food as determined by the appropriate method of analysis as given in the “Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International,” except when official AOAC procedures described in this paragraph (c)(7) require a specific factor other than 6.25, that specific factor shall be used.
</P>
<P>(i) A statement of the corrected amount of protein per serving, as determined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, calculated as a percentage of the RDI or DRV for protein, as appropriate, and expressed as Percent of Daily Value, may be placed on the label, except that such a statement shall be given if a protein claim is made for the product, or if the product is represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months or children 1 through 3 years of age. When such a declaration is provided, it should be placed on the label adjacent to the statement of grams of protein and aligned under the column headed “Percent Daily Value,” and expressed to the nearest whole percent. However, the percentage of the RDI for protein shall not be declared if the food is represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months and the protein quality value is less than 40 percent of the reference standard.
</P>
<P>(ii) The “corrected amount of protein (gram) per serving” for foods represented or purported for adults and children 1 or more years of age is equal to the actual amount of protein (gram) per serving multiplied by the amino acid score corrected for protein digestibility. If the corrected score is above 1.00, then it shall be set at 1.00. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score shall be determined by methods given in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8.00 in “Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,” except that when official AOAC procedures described in paragraph (c)(7) of this section require a specific factor other than 6.25, that specific factor shall be used. For foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months, the corrected amount of protein (grams) per serving is equal to the actual amount of protein (grams) per serving multiplied by the relative protein quality value. The relative protein quality value shall be determined by dividing the subject food protein PER value by the PER value for casein. If the relative protein value is above 1.00, it shall be set at 1.00.
</P>
<P>(iii) For the purpose of labeling with a percent of the DRV or RDI, a value of 50 grams of protein shall be the DRV for adults and children 4 or more years of age, a value of 11 grams of protein shall be the RDI for infants through 12 months, a value of 13 grams shall be the DRV for children 1 through 3 years of age, and a value of 71 grams of protein shall be the RDI for pregnant women and lactating women.
</P>
<P>(8) “Vitamins and minerals”: The requirements related to including a statement of the amount per serving of vitamins and minerals are described in this paragraph (c)(8).
</P>
<P>(i) For purposes of declaration of percent of Daily Value as provided for in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months, children 1 through 3 years, pregnant women, and lactating women shall use the RDIs that are specified for the intended group. For foods represented or purported to be specifically for both infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age, the percent of Daily Value shall be presented by separate declarations according to paragraph (e) of this section based on the RDI values for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age. When such dual declaration is used on any label, it shall be included in all labeling, and equal prominence shall be given to both values in all such labeling. The percent Daily Value based on the RDI values for pregnant women and lactating women shall be declared on food represented or purported to be specifically for pregnant women and lactating women. All other foods shall use the RDI for adults and children 4 or more years of age.
</P>
<P>(ii) The declaration of vitamins and minerals as a quantitative amount by weight and percent of the RDI shall include vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium in that order, for infants through 12 months, children 1 through 3 years of age, pregnant women, lactating women, and adults and children 4 or more years of age, except quantitative weights for these vitamins and minerals are not required for labels described in paragraph (j)(13) of this section. The declaration of folic acid shall be included as a quantitative amount by weight when added as a nutrient supplement or a claim is made about the nutrient. The declaration of vitamins and minerals in a food, as a quantitative amount by weight and percent of the RDI, may include any of the other vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section. The declaration of vitamins and minerals shall include any of the other vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section as a statement of the amount per serving of the vitamins and minerals as described in this paragraph (c)(8)(ii), calculated as a percent of the RDI and expressed as a percent of the Daily Value, when they are added as a nutrient supplement, or when a claim is made about them, unless otherwise stated as quantitative amount by weight and percent of the Daily Value. Other vitamins and minerals need not be declared if neither the nutrient nor the component is otherwise referred to on the label or the labeling or advertising and the vitamins and minerals are:
</P>
<P>(A) Required or permitted in a standardized food (e.g., thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin in enriched flour) and that standardized food is included as an ingredient (i.e., component) in another food; or
</P>
<P>(B) Included in a food solely for technological purposes and declared only in the ingredient statement. The declaration may also include any of the other vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are naturally occurring in the food. The additional vitamins and minerals shall be listed in the order established in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section.
</P>
<P>(iii) The percentages for vitamins and minerals shall be expressed to the nearest 2-percent increment up to and including the 10-percent level, the nearest 5-percent increment above 10 percent and up to and including the 50-percent level, and the nearest 10-percent increment above the 50-percent level. Quantitative amounts and percentages of vitamins and minerals present at less than 2 percent of the RDI are not required to be declared in nutrition labeling but may be declared by a zero or by the use of an asterisk (or other symbol) that refers to another asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table and that is followed by the statement “Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients)” or “Contains &lt;2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).” Alternatively, except as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section, if vitamin D, calcium, iron, or potassium is present in amounts less than 2 percent of the RDI, label declaration of the nutrient(s) is not required if the statement “Not a significant source of—(listing the vitamins or minerals omitted)” is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values. Either statement shall be in the same type size as nutrients that are indented. The quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals, excluding sodium, shall be the amount of the vitamin or mineral included in one serving of the product, using the units of measurement and the levels of significance given in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section, except that zeros following decimal points may be dropped, and additional levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient to express lower amounts (<I>e.g.,</I> the RDI for zinc is given in whole milligrams, but the quantitative amount may be declared in tenths of a milligram).

</P>
<P>(i) The name of each nutrient, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, shall be given in a column and followed immediately by the quantitative amount by weight for that nutrient appended with a “g” for grams, “mg” for milligrams, or “mcg” for micrograms as shown in paragraph (d)(12) of this section. The symbol “&lt;” may be used in place of “less than.”
</P>
<P>(ii) A listing of the percent of the DRV as established in paragraphs (c)(7)(iii) and (c)(9) of this section shall be given in a column aligned under the heading “% Daily Value” established in paragraph (d)(6) of this section with the percent expressed to the nearest whole percent for each nutrient declared in the column described in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section for which a DRV has been established, except that the percent for protein may be omitted as provided in paragraph (c)(7) of this section. The percent shall be calculated by dividing either the amount declared on the label for each nutrient or the actual amount of each nutrient (i.e., before rounding) by the DRV for the nutrient, except that the percent for protein shall be calculated as specified in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section. The numerical value shall be followed by the symbol for percent (i.e., %).
</P>
<P>(8) Nutrient information for vitamins and minerals (except sodium) shall be separated from information on other nutrients by a bar and may be arrayed vertically as shown in paragraph (d)(12) of this section (<I>e.g.,</I> Vitamin D 2 mcg 10%, Calcium 260 mg 20%, Iron 8 mg 45%, Potassium 235 mg 6%) or may be listed horizontally. When listed horizontally in two columns, vitamin D and calcium should be listed on the first line and iron and potassium should be listed on the second line, as shown in paragraph (d)(12) of this section in the side-by-side display. When more than four vitamins and minerals are declared voluntarily as shown in paragraph (d)(12) of this section in the label which illustrates the mandatory plus voluntary provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, they may be declared vertically with percentages listed under the column headed “% Daily Value.”

<P>(9) A footnote, preceded by an asterisk, shall be placed beneath the list of vitamins and minerals and shall be separated from the list by a bar, except that the footnote may be omitted from foods that can use the terms “calorie free,” “free of calories,” “without calories,” “trivial source of calories,” “negligible source of calories,” or “dietary insignificant source of calories” on the label or in the labeling of foods as defined in § 101.60(b). The first sentence of the footnote: “The % Daily Value tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet” may be used on foods that can use the terms “calorie free,” “free of calories,” “without calories,” “trivial source of calories,” “negligible source of calories,” or “dietary insignificant source of calories” on the label or in the labeling of foods as defined in § 101.60(b). The footnote shall state: “*The % Daily Value tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice.” If the food product is represented or purported to be for children 1 through 3 years of age, the second sentence of the footnote shall substitute “1,000 calories” for “2,000 calories.”
</P>
<P>(10) Caloric conversion information on a per gram basis for fat, carbohydrate, and protein may be presented beneath the information required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, separated from that information by a hairline. This information may be presented horizontally as shown in paragraph (d)(12) of this section (i.e., “Calories per gram: fat 9, carbohydrate 4, protein 4”) or vertically in columns.
</P>
<P>(11)(i) If the space beneath the information on vitamins and minerals is not adequate to accommodate the information required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, the information required in paragraph (d)(9) may be moved to the right of the column required in paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section and set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the percent Daily Value information. The caloric conversion information provided for in paragraph (d)(10) of this section may be presented beneath either side or along the full length of the nutrition label.
</P>
<P>(ii) If the space beneath the mandatory declaration of potassium is not adequate to accommodate any remaining vitamins and minerals to be declared or the information required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, the remaining information may be moved to the right and set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the nutrients and the percent DV information given to the left. The caloric conversion information provided for in paragraph (d)(10) of this section may be presented beneath either side or along the full length of the nutrition label.
</P>
<P>(iii) If there is not sufficient continuous vertical space (<I>i.e.,</I> approximately 3 in) to accommodate the required components of the nutrition label up to and including the mandatory declaration of potassium, the nutrition label may be presented in a tabular display as shown in the following sample label.
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er24mr23.011.gif"/>
<P>(12) The following sample labels illustrate the mandatory provisions and mandatory plus voluntary provisions of paragraph (d) of this section and the side-by-side display.

<P>(13)(i) Nutrition labels on the outer label of packages of products that contain two or more separately packaged foods that are intended to be eaten individually (e.g., variety packs of cereals or snack foods) or of packages that are used interchangeably for the same type of food (e.g., round ice cream containers) may use an aggregate display.
</P>
<P>(ii) Aggregate displays shall comply with the format requirements of paragraph (d) of this section to the maximum extent possible, except that the identity of each food shall be specified immediately to the right of the “Nutrition Facts” heading, and both the quantitative amount by weight (<I>i.e.,</I> g/mg/mcg amounts) and the percent Daily Value for each nutrient shall be listed in separate columns under the name of each food. The following sample label illustrates an aggregate display.
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er27my16.004.gif"/>
<P>(14) In accordance with § 101.15(c)(2), when nutrition labeling must appear in a second language, the nutrition information may be presented in a separate nutrition label for each language or in one nutrition label with the information in the second language following that in English. Numeric characters that are identical in both languages need not be repeated (e.g., “Protein/Proteinas 2 g”). All required information must be included in both languages.
</P>
<P>(e) Nutrition information may be presented for two or more forms of the same food (<I>e.g.,</I> both “as purchased” and “as prepared”) or for common combinations of food as provided for in paragraph (h)(4) of this section, for different units (<I>e.g.,</I> slices of bread or per 100 grams) as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, or for two or more groups for which RDIs are established (<I>e.g.,</I> both infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age) as shown in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. When such dual labeling is provided, equal prominence shall be given to both sets of values. Information shall be presented in a format consistent with paragraph (d) of this section, except that:
</P>
<P>(1) Following the serving size information there shall be two or more column headings accurately describing the amount per serving size of the form of the same food (<I>e.g.,</I> “Per 
<FR>1/4</FR> cup mix” and “Per prepared portion”), the combinations of food, the units, or the RDI groups that are being declared as shown in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) The quantitative information by weight as required in paragraph (d)(7)(i) and the information required in paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section shall be presented for the form of the product as packaged and for any other form of the product (<I>e.g.,</I> “as prepared” or combined with another ingredient as shown in paragraph (e)(5) of this section).
</P>
<P>(3) When the dual labeling is presented for two or more forms of the same food, for combinations of food, for different units, or for two or more groups for which RDIs are established, the quantitative information by weight and the percent Daily Value shall be presented in two columns and the columns shall be separated by vertical lines as shown in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
</P>
<P>(4) Nutrient information for vitamins and minerals (except sodium) shall be separated from information on other nutrients by a bar and shall be arrayed vertically in the following order: Vitamin D, calcium, iron, potassium as shown in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
</P>
<P>(5) The following sample label illustrates the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section:
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er21de18.010.gif"/>
<P>(6) When dual labeling is presented for a food on a per serving basis and per container basis as required in paragraph (b)(12)(i) of this section or on a per serving basis and per unit basis as required in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(D) of this section, the quantitative information by weight as required in paragraph (d)(7)(i) and the percent Daily Value as required in paragraph (d)(7)(ii) shall be presented in two columns, and the columns shall be separated by vertical lines as shown in the displays in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section.
</P>
<P>(i) Nutrient information for vitamins and minerals shall be separated from information on other nutrients by a bar and shall be arrayed vertically in the following order: Vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium as shown in the following sample labels.
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er21de18.011.gif"/>
<img src="/graphics/er21de18.012.gif"/>
<P>(ii) The following sample label illustrates the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(D) and (b)(12)(i) of this section for labels that use the tabular display.
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er21de18.013.gif"/>
<P>(f) The declaration of nutrition information may be presented in the simplified format set forth herein when a food product contains insignificant amounts of eight or more of the following: Calories, total fat, saturated fat, <I>trans</I> fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium; except that for foods intended for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age to which paragraph (j)(5)(i) of this section applies, nutrition information may be presented in the simplified format when a food product contains insignificant amounts of six or more of the following: Calories, total fat, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium.
</P>
<P>(1) An “insignificant amount” shall be defined as that amount that allows a declaration of zero in nutrition labeling, except that for total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, and protein, it shall be an amount that allows a declaration of “less than 1 gram.”
</P>
<P>(2) The simplified format shall include information on the following nutrients:
</P>
<P>(i) Total calories, total fat, total carbohydrate, protein, and sodium;
</P>
<P>(ii) Any other nutrients identified in paragraph (f) of this section that are present in the food in more than insignificant amounts; and
</P>
<P>(iii) Any vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are required to be added as a nutrient supplement to foods for which a standard of identity exists.
</P>
<P>(iv) Any vitamins or minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section voluntarily added to the food as nutrient supplements.
</P>
<P>(3) Other nutrients that are naturally present in the food in more than insignificant amounts may be voluntarily declared as part of the simplified format.
</P>
<P>(4) If any nutrients are declared as provided in paragraphs (f)(2)(iii), (f)(2)(iv), or (f)(3) of this section as part of the simplified format or if any nutrition claims are made on the label or in labeling, the statement “Not a significant source of ________” (with the blank filled in with the name(s) of any nutrient(s) identified in paragraph (f) of this section that are present in insignificant amounts) shall be included at the bottom of the nutrition label.
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er27my16.008.gif"/>
<P>(5) Except as provided for in paragraphs (j)(5) and (j)(13) of this section, nutrient information declared in the simplified format shall be presented in the same manner as specified in paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, except that the footnote required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section is not required, and an asterisk shall be placed at the bottom of the label followed by the statement “% DV = % Daily Value” when “Daily Value” is not spelled out in the heading, as shown in paragraph (f)(4).
</P>
<P>(g) Compliance with this section shall be determined as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) A collection of primary containers or units of the same size, type, and style produced under conditions as nearly uniform as possible, designated by a common container code or marking, or in the absence of any common container code or marking, a day's production, constitutes a “lot.”
</P>
<P>(2) The sample for nutrient analysis shall consist of a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer units), taken 1 from each of 12 different randomly chosen shipping cases, to be representative of a lot. Unless a particular method of analysis is specified in paragraph (c) of this section, composites shall be analyzed by appropriate methods as given in the “Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International,” or, if no AOAC method is available or appropriate, by other reliable and appropriate analytical procedures.
</P>
<P>(3) Two classes of nutrients are defined for purposes of compliance:
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Class I.</I> Added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Class II. Naturally occurring (indigenous) nutrients. When a nutrient is naturally occurring (indigenous) in a food or an ingredient that is added to a food, the total amount of such nutrient in the final food product is subject to class II requirements, except that when an exogenous source of the nutrient is also added to the final food product, the total amount of the nutrient in the final food product (indigenous and exogenous) is subject to class I requirements.
</P>
<P>(4) A food with a label declaration of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat shall be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) unless it meets the following requirements:
</P>
<P>(i) When a vitamin, mineral, protein, or dietary fiber meets the definition of a Class I nutrient, the nutrient content of the composite must be formulated to be at least equal to the value for that nutrient declared on the label.
</P>
<P>(ii) When a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber meets the definition of a Class II nutrient, the nutrient content of the composite must be at least equal to 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label. <I>Provided,</I> That no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls below this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved.
</P>
<P>(5) A food with a label declaration of calories, total sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, <I>trans</I> fat, cholesterol, or sodium shall be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the act if the nutrient content of the composite is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label. <I>Provided,</I> That no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved.
</P>
<P>(6) Reasonable excesses of vitamins, minerals, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, sugar alcohols, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat over labeled amounts are acceptable within current good manufacturing practice. Reasonable deficiencies of calories, total sugars, added sugars, total fat, saturated fat, <I>trans</I> fat, cholesterol, or sodium under labeled amounts are acceptable within current good manufacturing practice.
</P>
<P>(7) Compliance will be based on the metric measure specified in the label statement of serving size.
</P>
<P>(8) Alternatively, compliance with the provisions set forth in paragraphs (g)(1) through (6) of this section may be provided by use of an FDA approved database that has been computed following FDA guideline procedures and where food samples have been handled in accordance with current good manufacturing practice to prevent nutrition loss. FDA approval of a database shall not be considered granted until the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition has agreed to all aspects of the database in writing. The approval will be granted where a clear need is presented (<I>e.g.,</I> raw produce and seafood). Approvals will be in effect for a limited time, <I>e.g.,</I> 10 years, and will be eligible for renewal in the absence of significant changes in agricultural or industry practices. Approval requests shall be submitted in accordance with the provisions of § 10.30 of this chapter. Guidance in the use of databases may be found in the “FDA Nutrition Labeling Manual—A Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases,” available from the Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling (HFS-800), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740 or by going to <I>http://www.fda.gov</I>.
</P>
<P>(9) When it is not technologically feasible, or some other circumstance makes it impracticable, for firms to comply with the requirements of this section (e.g., to develop adequate nutrient profiles to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section), FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to deal with the situation. Firms in need of such special allowances shall make their request in writing to the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740.
</P>
<P>(10) The manufacturer must make and keep written records (<I>e.g.,</I> analyses of databases, recipes, formulations, information from recipes or formulations, or batch records) to verify the declared amount of that nutrient on the Nutrition Facts label as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) When a mixture of dietary fiber, and added non-digestible carbohydrate(s) that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber, is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of non-digestible carbohydrate(s) added to the food that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber.
</P>
<P>(ii) When a mixture of soluble fiber and added non-digestible carbohydrate(s) that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records necessary to verify the amount of the non-digestible carbohydrate(s) added to the food that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber.
</P>
<P>(iii) When a mixture of insoluble fiber and added non-digestible carbohydrate(s) that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records necessary to verify the amount of the non-digestible carbohydrate(s) added to the food that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber.
</P>
<P>(iv) When a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient).
</P>
<P>(v) When the amount of sugars added to food products is reduced through non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, manufacturers must:
</P>
<P>(A) Make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information relied upon by the manufacturer that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation; or
</P>
<P>(B) Make and keep records of the amount of added sugars added to the food before and during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) and in no event shall the amount of added sugars declared exceed the amount of total sugars on the label; or
</P>
<P>(C) Submit a petition, under 21 CFR 10.30, to request an alternative means of compliance. The petition must provide scientific data or other information for why the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product is likely to have a significant reduction in added sugars compared to the amount added prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation. A significant reduction would be where reduction in added sugars after non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation may be significant enough to impact the label declaration for added sugars by an amount that exceeds the reasonable deficiency acceptable within good manufacturing practice under paragraph (g)(6) of this section. In addition, the scientific data or other information must include the reason that the manufacturer is unable to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in a serving of their finished product and a description of the process that they used to come to that conclusion.
</P>
<P>(vi) When a mixture of <I>all rac</I>-α-tocopherol and RRR-α-tocopherol is present in a food, manufacturers must make and keep written records of the amount of <I>all rac</I>-α-tocopherol added to the food and RRR-α-tocopherol in the finished food.
</P>
<P>(vii) When a mixture of folate and folic acid is present in a food, manufacturers must make and keep written records of the amount of synthetic folate and/or folic acid added to the food and the amount of naturally-occurring folate in the finished food.
</P>
<P>(11) Records necessary to verify certain nutrient declarations that are specified in paragraph (g)(10) of this section must be kept for a period of at least 2 years after introduction or delivery for introduction of the food into interstate commerce. Such records must be provided to FDA upon request, during an inspection, for official review and photocopying or other means of reproduction. Records required to verify information on the label may be kept either as original records, true copies (such as photocopies, pictures, scanned copies, microfilm, microfiche, or other accurate reproductions of the original records), or electronic records which must be kept in accordance with part 11 of this chapter. These records must be accurate, indelible, and legible.
</P>
<P>Failure to make and keep the records or provide the records to appropriate regulatory authorities, as required by this paragraph (g)(11), would result in the food being misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the act.
</P>
<P>(h) Products with separately packaged ingredients or foods, with assortments of food, or to which other ingredients are added by the user may be labeled as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) If a product consists of two or more separately packaged ingredients enclosed in an outer container or of assortments of the same type of food (e.g., assorted nuts or candy mixtures) in the same retail package, nutrition labeling shall be located on the outer container or retail package (as the case may be) to provide information for the consumer at the point of purchase. However, when two or more food products are simply combined together in such a manner that no outer container is used, or no outer label is available, each product shall have its own nutrition information, e.g., two boxes taped together or two cans combined in a clear plastic overwrap. When separately packaged ingredients or assortments of the same type of food are intended to be eaten at the same time, the nutrition information may be specified per serving for each component or as a composite value.
</P>
<P>(2) If a product consists of two or more separately packaged foods that are intended to be eaten individually and that are enclosed in an outer container (e.g., variety packs of cereals or snack foods), the nutrition information shall:
</P>
<P>(i) Be specified per serving for each food in a location that is clearly visible to the consumer at the point of purchase; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Be presented in separate nutrition labels or in one aggregate nutrition label with separate columns for the quantitative amount by weight and the percent Daily Value for each food.
</P>
<P>(3) If a package contains a variety of foods, or an assortment of foods, and is in a form intended to be used as a gift, the nutrition labeling shall be in the form required by paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, but it may be modified as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) Nutrition information may be presented on the label of the outer package or in labeling within or attached to the outer package.
</P>
<P>(ii) In the absence of a reference amount customarily consumed in § 101.12(b) that is appropriate for the variety or assortment of foods in a gift package, the following may be used as the standard serving size for purposes of nutrition labeling of foods subject to this paragraph: 1 ounce for solid foods; 2 fluid ounces for nonbeverage liquids (<I>e.g.,</I> syrups); 8 ounces for beverages that consist of milk and fruit juices, nectars and fruit drinks; and 12 fluid ounces for other beverages. However, the reference amounts customarily consumed in § 101.12(b) shall be used for purposes of evaluating whether individual foods in a gift package qualify for nutrient content claims or health claims.
</P>
<P>(iii) The number of servings per container may be stated as “varied.”
</P>
<P>(iv) Nutrition information may be provided per serving for individual foods in the package, or, alternatively, as a composite per serving for reasonable categories of foods in the package having similar dietary uses and similar significant nutritional characteristics. Reasonable categories of foods may be used only if accepted by FDA. In determining whether a proposed category is reasonable, FDA will consider whether the values of the characterizing nutrients in the foods proposed to be in the category meet the compliance criteria set forth in paragraphs (g)(3) through (6) of this section. Proposals for such categories may be submitted in writing to the Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling (HFS-800), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740.
</P>
<P>(v) If a food subject to paragraph (j)(13) of this section because of its small size is contained in a gift package, the food need not be included in the determination of nutrition information under paragraph (h) of this section if it is not specifically listed in a promotional catalogue as being present in the gift package, and:
</P>
<P>(A) It is used in small quantities primarily to enhance the appearance of the gift package; or
</P>
<P>(B) It is included in the gift package as a free gift or promotional item.
</P>
<P>(4) If a food is commonly combined with other ingredients or is cooked or otherwise prepared before eating, and directions for such combination or preparations are provided, another column of figures may be used to declare nutrition information on the basis of the food as consumed in the format required in paragraph (e) of this section; <I>e.g.,</I> a dry ready-to-eat cereal may be described with the percent Daily Value and the quantitative amounts for the cereal as sold (<I>e.g.,</I> per ounce), and the percent Daily Value and the quantitative amounts for the cereal and milk as suggested in the label (<I>e.g.,</I> per ounce of cereal and 
<FR>1/2</FR>cup of vitamin D fortified skim milk); and a cake mix may be labeled with the percent Daily Value and the quantitative amounts for the dry mix (per serving) and the percent Daily Value and the quantitative amounts for the serving of the final cake when prepared, as shown in paragraph (e)(5) of this section: Provided, that, the type and quantity of the other ingredients to be added to the product by the user and the specific method of cooking and other preparation shall be specified prominently on the label.
</P>
<P>(i) Except as provided in paragraphs (j)(13) and (j)(17) of this section, the location of nutrition information on a label shall be in compliance with § 101.2.
</P>
<P>(j) The following foods are exempt from this section or are subject to special labeling requirements:
</P>
<P>(1)(i) Food offered for sale by a person who makes direct sales to consumers (<I>e.g.,</I> a retailer) who has annual gross sales made or business done in sales to consumers that is not more than $500,000 or has annual gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers of not more than $50,000, <I>Provided,</I> That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising. Claims or other nutrition information subject the food to the provisions of this section, § 101.10, or § 101.11, as applicable.
</P>
<P>(ii) For purposes of this paragraph, calculation of the amount of sales shall be based on the most recent 2-year average of business activity. Where firms have been in business less than 2 years, reasonable estimates must indicate that annual sales will not exceed the amounts specified. For foreign firms that ship foods into the United States, the business activities to be included shall be the total amount of food sales, as well as other sales to consumers, by the firm in the United States.
</P>
<P>(2) Except as provided in § 101.11, food products that are:
</P>
<P>(i) Served in restaurants, <I>Provided,</I> That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising. Claims or other nutrition information subject the food to the provisions of this section;
</P>
<P>(ii) Served in other establishments in which food is served for immediate human consumption (<I>e.g.,</I> institutional food service establishments, such as schools, hospitals, and cafeterias; transportation carriers, such as trains and airplanes; bakeries, delicatessens, and retail confectionery stores where there are facilities for immediate consumption on the premises; food service vendors, such as lunch wagons, ice cream shops, mall cookie counters, vending machines, and sidewalk carts where foods are generally consumed immediately where purchased or while the consumer is walking away, including similar foods sold from convenience stores; and food delivery systems or establishments where ready-to-eat foods are delivered to homes or offices), <I>Provided,</I> That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising, except as provided in § 101.8(c). Claims or other nutrition information, except as provided in § 101.8(c), subject the food to the provisions of this section;
</P>
<P>(iii) Sold only in such facilities, <I>Provided,</I> That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising. Claims or other nutrition information subject the food to the provisions of this section;
</P>
<P>(iv) Used only in such facilities and not served to the consumer in the package in which they are received (e.g., foods that are not packaged in individual serving containers); or
</P>
<P>(v) Sold by a distributor who principally sells food to such facilities: <I>Provided,</I> That:
</P>
<P>(A) This exemption shall not be available for those foods that are manufactured, processed, or repackaged by that distributor for sale to any persons other than restaurants or other establishments that serve food for immediate human consumption, and
</P>
<P>(B) The manufacturer of such products is responsible for providing the nutrition information on the products if there is a reasonable possibility that the product will be purchased directly by consumers.
</P>
<P>(3) Except as provided in § 101.11, food products that are:
</P>
<P>(i) Of the type of food described in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (j)(2)(ii) of this section,
</P>
<P>(ii) Ready for human consumption,
</P>
<P>(iii) Offered for sale to consumers but not for immediate human consumption,
</P>
<P>(iv) Processed and prepared primarily in a retail establishment, and
</P>
<P>(v) Not offered for sale outside of that establishment (e.g., ready-to-eat foods that are processed and prepared on-site and sold by independent delicatessens, bakeries, or retail confectionery stores where there are no facilities for immediate human consumption; by in-store delicatessen, bakery, or candy departments; or at self-service food bars such as salad bars), <I>Provided,</I> That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising. Claims or other nutrition information subject the food to the provisions of this section.
</P>
<P>(4) Except as provided in § 101.11, foods that contain insignificant amounts of all of the nutrients and food components required to be included in the declaration of nutrition information under paragraph (c) of this section, <I>Provided,</I> That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising. Claims or other nutrition information, except as provided in § 101.8(c), subject the food to the provisions of this section. An insignificant amount of a nutrient or food component shall be that amount that allows a declaration of zero in nutrition labeling, except that for total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, and protein, it shall be an amount that allows a declaration of “less than 1 gram.” Examples of foods that are exempt under this paragraph include coffee beans (whole or ground), tea leaves, plain unsweetened instant coffee and tea, condiment-type dehydrated vegetables, flavor extracts, and food colors.
</P>
<P>(5)(i) Foods, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age shall bear nutrition labeling.

<P>(8) Medical foods as defined in section 5(b) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 U.S.C. 360ee(b)(3)). A medical food is a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation. A food is subject to this exemption only if:
</P>
<P>(i) It is a specially formulated and processed product (as opposed to a naturally occurring foodstuff used in its natural state) for the partial or exclusive feeding of a patient by means of oral intake or enteral feeding by tube;
</P>
<P>(ii) It is intended for the dietary management of a patient who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, has limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, or who has other special medically determined nutrient requirements, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved by the modification of the normal diet alone;
</P>
<P>(iii) It provides nutritional support specifically modified for the management of the unique nutrient needs that result from the specific disease or condition, as determined by medical evaluation;
</P>
<P>(iv) It is intended to be used under medical supervision; and

</P>
<P>(9) Food products shipped in bulk form that are not for distribution to consumers in such form and that are for use solely in the manufacture of other foods or that are to be processed, labeled, or repacked at a site other than where originally processed or packed.
</P>
<P>(10) Raw fruits, vegetables, and fish subject to section 403(q)(4) of the act, except that the labeling of such foods should adhere to guidelines in § 101.45. This exemption is contingent on the food bearing no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising. Claims or other nutrition information subject the food to nutrition labeling in accordance with § 101.45. The term <I>fish</I> includes freshwater or marine fin fish, crustaceans, and mollusks, including shellfish, amphibians, and other forms of aquatic animal life.
</P>
<P>(11) Packaged single-ingredient products that consist of fish or game meat (i.e., animal products not covered under the Federal Meat Inspection Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act, such as flesh products from deer, bison, rabbit, quail, wild turkey, or ostrich) subject to this section may provide required nutrition information for a 3-ounce cooked edible portion (i.e., on an “as prepared” basis), except that:
</P>
<P>(i) Such products that make claims that are based on values as packaged must provide nutrition information on an as packaged basis, and
</P>
<P>(ii) Nutrition information is not required for custom processed fish or game meats.
</P>
<P>(12) Game meats (i.e., animal products not covered under the Federal Meat Inspection Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act, such as flesh products from deer, bison, rabbit, quail, wild turkey, or ostrich) may provide required nutrition information on labeling in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

<P>(13)(i) Foods in small packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, <I>Provided,</I> That the labels for these foods bear no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising, except as provided in § 101.8(c). Claims or other nutrition information, except as provided in § 101.8(c), subject the food to the provisions of this section. Foods in packages subject to requirements of paragraphs (j)(13)(ii)(A)(<I>1</I>) and (<I>2</I>) of this section do not require the information in paragraphs (d)(9) and (f)(5) related to the footnote, however the abbreviated footnote statement “% DV = % Daily Value” may be used.
</P>
<P>(A) The manufacturer, packer, or distributor shall provide on the label of packages that qualify for and use this exemption an address or telephone number that a consumer can use to obtain the required nutrition information (<I>e.g.,</I> “For nutrition information, call 1-800-123-4567”).
</P>
<P>(B) When such products bear nutrition labeling, either voluntarily or because nutrition claims or other nutrition information is provided, all required information shall be in type size no smaller than 6 point or all upper-case type of 
<FR>1/16</FR> inches minimum height, except that individual serving-size packages of food served with meals in restaurants, institutions, and on board passenger carriers, and not intended for sale at retail, may comply with § 101.2(c)(2).
</P>
<P>(ii) Foods in packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches may modify the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (f) and (i) of this section by one or more of the following means:
</P>
<P>(A) Presenting the required nutrition information in a tabular or, as provided below, linear (i.e., string) fashion rather than in vertical columns if the product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, or if the product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches and the package shape or size cannot accommodate a standard vertical column or tabular display on any label panel. Nutrition information may be given in a linear fashion only if the label will not accommodate a tabular display.
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) The following sample label illustrates the tabular display for small packages.
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er24mr23.013.gif"/>

Nonmandatory label information on the information panel shall not be considered in determining the sufficiency of available space for the placement of the nutrition label.
</P>
<P>(18) Food products that are low-volume (that is, they meet the requirements for units sold in paragraphs (j)(18)(i) or (j)(18)(ii) of this section); that, except as provided in paragraph (j)(18)(iv) of this section, are the subject of a claim for an exemption that provides the information required under paragraph (j)(18)(iv) of this section, that is filed before the beginning of the time period for which the exemption is claimed, and that is filed by a person, whether it is the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, that qualifies to claim the exemption under the requirements for average full-time equivalent employees in paragraphs (j)(18)(i) or (j)(18)(ii) of this section; and whose labels, labeling, and advertising do not provide nutrition information or make a nutrient content or health claim. 
</P>
<P>(i) For food products first introduced into interstate commerce before May 8, 1994, the product shall be exempt for the period: 
</P>
<P>(A) Between May 8, 1995, and May 7, 1996, if, for the period between May 8, 1994, and May 7, 1995, the person claiming the exemption employed fewer than an average of 300 full-time equivalent employees and fewer than 400,000 units of that product were sold in the United States; and 
</P>
<P>(B) Between May 8, 1996, and May 7, 1997, if for the period between May 8, 1995, and May 7, 1996, the person claiming the exemption employed fewer than an average of 200 full-time equivalent employees and fewer than 200,000 units of that product were sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>(ii) For all other food products, the product shall be eligible for an exemption for any 12-month period if, for the preceding 12 months, the person claiming the exemption employed fewer than an average of 100 full-time equivalent employees and fewer than 100,000 units of that product were sold in the United States, or in the case of a food product that was not sold in the 12-month period preceding the period for which exemption is claimed, fewer than 100,000 units of such product are reasonably anticipated to be sold in the United States during the period for which exemption is claimed. 
</P>
<P>(iii) If a person claims an exemption under paragraphs (j)(18)(i) or (j)(18)(ii) of this section for a food product and then, during the period of such exemption, the number of full-time equivalent employees of such person exceeds the appropriate number, or the number of food products sold in the United States exceeds the appropriate number, or, if at the end of the period of such exemption, the food product no longer qualifies for an exemption under the provisions of paragraphs (j)(18)(i) or (j)(18)(ii) of this section, such person shall have 18 months from the date that the product was no longer qualified as a low-volume product of a small business to comply with this section.

</P>
<P>(D) The number of full-time equivalent employees. Provide the average number of full-time equivalent individuals employed by the person and its affiliates for the 12 months preceding the period for which a small business exemption is claimed for a product. The average number of full-time equivalent employees is to be determined by dividing the total number of hours of salary or wages paid to employees of the person and its affiliates by the number of hours of work in a year, 2,080 hours (i.e., 40 hours × 52 weeks); 
</P>
<P>(E) Approximate total number of units of the food product sold by the person in the United States in the 12-month period preceding that for which a small business exemption is claimed. Provide the approximate total number of units sold, or expected to be sold, in a 12-month period for each product for which an exemption is claimed. For products that have been in production for 1 year or more prior to the period for which exemption is claimed, the 12-month period is the period immediately preceding the period for which an exemption is claimed. For other products, the 12-month period is the period for which an exemption is claimed; and 
</P>
<P>(F) The notice shall be signed by a responsible individual for the person who can certify the accuracy of the information presented in the notice. The individual shall certify that the information contained in the notice is a complete and accurate statement of the average number of full-time equivalent employees of this person and its affiliates and of the number of units of the product for which an exemption is claimed sold by the person. The individual shall also state that should the average number of full-time equivalent employees or the number of units of food products sold in the United States by the person exceed the applicable numbers for the time period for which exemption is claimed, the person will notify FDA of that fact and the date on which the number of employees or the number of products sold exceeded the standard. 
</P>
<P>(v) FDA may by regulation lower the employee or units of food products requirements of paragraph (j)(18)(ii) of this section for any food product first introduced into interstate commerce after May 8, 2002, if the agency determines that the cost of compliance with such lower requirement will not place an undue burden on persons subject to it. 
</P>
<P>(vi) For the purposes of this paragraph, the following definitions apply: 
</P>
<P>(A) <I>Unit</I> means the packaging or, if there is no packaging, the form in which a food product is offered for sale to consumers. 
</P>
<P>(B) <I>Food product</I> means food in any sized package which is manufactured by a single manufacturer or which bears the same brand name, which bears the same statement of identity, and which has similar preparation methods. 
</P>

</P>
<P>(D) <I>Full-time equivalent employee</I> means all individuals employed by the person claiming the exemption. This number shall be determined by dividing the total number of hours of salary or wages paid directly to employees of the person and of all of its affiliates by the number of hours of work in a year, 2,080 hours (i.e., 40 hours × 52 weeks). 
</P>
<P>(k) A food labeled under the provisions of this section shall be deemed to be misbranded under sections 201(n) and 403(a) of the act if its label or labeling represents, suggests, or implies:
</P>
<P>(1) That the food, because of the presence or absence of certain dietary properties, is adequate or effective in the prevention, cure, mitigation, or treatment of any disease or symptom. Information about the relationship of a dietary property to a disease or health-related condition may only be provided in conformance with the requirements of § 101.14 and part 101, subpart E.
</P>
<P>(2) That the lack of optimum nutritive quality of a food, by reason of the soil on which that food was grown, is or may be responsible for an inadequacy or deficiency in the quality of the daily diet.
</P>
<P>(3) That the storage, transportation, processing, or cooking of a food is or may be responsible for an inadequacy or deficiency in the quality of the daily diet.
</P>
<P>(4) That a natural vitamin in a food is superior to an added or synthetic vitamin.

<HEAD>§ 101.10   Nutrition labeling of restaurant foods whose labels or labeling bear nutrient content claims or health claims.</HEAD>
<P>Nutrition labeling in accordance with § 101.9 shall be provided upon request for any restaurant food or meal for which a nutrient content claim (as defined in § 101.13 or in subpart D of this part) or a health claim (as defined in § 101.14 and permitted by a regulation in subpart E of this part) is made, except that information on the nutrient amounts that are the basis for the claim (<I>e.g.,</I> “low fat, this meal provides less than 10 grams of fat”) may serve as the functional equivalent of complete nutrition information as described in § 101.9. For the purposes of this section, restaurant food includes two categories of food. It includes food which is served in restaurants or other establishments in which food is served for immediate human consumption or which is sold for sale or use in such establishments. It also includes food which is processed and prepared primarily in a retail establishment, which is ready for human consumption, which is of the type described in the previous sentence, and which is offered for sale to consumers but not for immediate human consumption in such establishment and which is not offered for sale outside such establishment. For standard menu items that are offered for sale in covered establishments (as defined in § 101.11(a)), the information in the written nutrition information required by § 101.11(b)(2)(ii)(A) will serve to meet the requirements of this section. Nutrient levels may be determined by nutrient databases, cookbooks, or analyses or by other reasonable bases that provide assurance that the food or meal meets the nutrient requirements for the claim. Presentation of nutrition labeling may be in various forms, including those provided in § 101.45 and other reasonable means.

<DIV8 N="101.11" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="2">
<HEAD>§ 101.11   Nutrition labeling of standard menu items in covered establishments.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Definitions.</I> The definitions of terms in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act apply to such terms when used in this section. In addition, for purposes of this section:
</P>
<P><I>Authorized official of a restaurant or similar retail food establishment</I> means the owner, operator, agent in charge, or other person authorized by the owner, operator, or agent in charge to register the restaurant or similar retail food establishment, which is not otherwise subject to section 403(q)(5)(H) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, with FDA for the purposes of paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P><I>Combination meal</I> means a standard menu item that consists of more than one food item, for example a meal that includes a sandwich, a side dish, and a drink. A combination meal may be represented on the menu or menu board in narrative form, numerically, or pictorially. Some combination meals may include a variable menu item or be a variable menu item as defined in this paragraph where the components may vary. For example, the side dish may vary among several options (<I>e.g.,</I> fries, salad, or onion rings) or the drinks may vary (<I>e.g.,</I> soft drinks, milk, or juice) and the customer selects which of these items will be included in the meal.
</P>
<P><I>Covered establishment</I> means a restaurant or similar retail food establishment that is a part of a chain with 20 or more locations doing business under the same name (regardless of the type of ownership, <I>e.g.,</I> individual franchises) and offering for sale substantially the same menu items, as well as a restaurant or similar retail food establishment that is registered to be covered under paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P><I>Custom order</I> means a food order that is prepared in a specific manner based on an individual customer's request, which requires the covered establishment to deviate from its usual preparation of a standard menu item, <I>e.g.,</I> a club sandwich without the bacon if the establishment usually includes bacon in its club sandwich.
</P>
<P><I>Daily special</I> means a menu item that is prepared and offered for sale on a particular day, that is not routinely listed on a menu or menu board or offered by the covered establishment, and that is promoted by the covered establishment as a special menu item for that particular day.
</P>
<P><I>Doing business under the same name</I> means sharing the same name. The term “name” refers to either:
</P>
<P>(i) The name of the establishment presented to the public; or
</P>
<P>(ii) If there is no name of the establishment presented to the public (<I>e.g.,</I> an establishment with the generic descriptor “concession stand”), the name of the parent entity of the establishment. When the term “name” refers to the name of the establishment presented to the public under paragraph (i) of this definition, the term “same” includes names that are slight variations of each other, for example, due to the region, location, or size (<I>e.g.,</I> “New York Ave. Burgers” and “Pennsylvania Ave. Burgers” or “ABC” and “ABC Express”).
</P>
<P><I>Food on display</I> means restaurant-type food that is visible to the customer before the customer makes a selection, so long as there is not an ordinary expectation of further preparation by the consumer before consumption.
</P>
<P><I>Food that is part of a customary market test</I> means food that appears on a menu or menu board for less than 90 consecutive days in order to test consumer acceptance of the product.
</P>
<P><I>Location</I> means a fixed position or site.
</P>
<P><I>Menu or menu board</I> means the primary writing of the covered establishment from which a customer makes an order selection, including, but not limited to, breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus; dessert menus; beverage menus; children's menus; other specialty menus; electronic menus; and menus on the Internet. Determining whether a writing is or is part of the primary writing of the covered establishment from which a customer makes an order selection depends on a number of factors, including whether the writing lists the name of a standard menu item (or an image depicting the standard menu item) and the price of the standard menu item, and whether the writing can be used by a customer to make an order selection at the time the customer is viewing the writing. The menus may be in different forms, <I>e.g.,</I> booklets, pamphlets, or single sheets of paper. Menu boards include those inside a covered establishment as well as drive-through menu boards at covered establishments.
</P>
<P><I>Offering for sale substantially the same menu items</I> means offering for sale a significant proportion of menu items that use the same general recipe and are prepared in substantially the same way with substantially the same food components, even if the name of the menu item varies, (<I>e.g.,</I> “Bay View Crab Cake” and “Ocean View Crab Cake”). “Menu items” in this definition refers to food items that are listed on a menu or menu board or that are offered as self-service food or food on display. Restaurants and similar retail food establishments that are part of a chain can still be offering for sale substantially the same menu items if the availability of some menu items varies within the chain. Having the same name may indicate, but does not necessarily guarantee, that menu items are substantially the same.
</P>
<P><I>Restaurant or similar retail food establishment</I> means a retail establishment that offers for sale restaurant-type food, except if it is a school as defined by 7 CFR 210.2 or 220.2.
</P>
<P><I>Restaurant-type food</I> means food that is:
</P>
<P>(i) Usually eaten on the premises, while walking away, or soon after arriving at another location; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Either:
</P>
<P>(A) Served in restaurants or other establishments in which food is served for immediate human consumption or which is sold for sale or use in such establishments; or
</P>
<P>(B) Processed and prepared primarily in a retail establishment, ready for human consumption, of the type described in paragraph (ii)(A) of this definition, and offered for sale to consumers but not for immediate human consumption in such establishment and which is not offered for sale outside such establishment.
</P>
<P><I>Self-service food</I> means restaurant-type food that is available at a salad bar, buffet line, cafeteria line, or similar self-service facility and that is served by the customers themselves. Self-service food also includes self-service beverages.
</P>
<P><I>Standard menu item</I> means a restaurant-type food that is routinely included on a menu or menu board or routinely offered as a self-service food or food on display.
</P>
<P><I>Temporary menu item</I> means a food that appears on a menu or menu board for less than a total of 60 days per calendar year. The 60 days includes the total of consecutive and non-consecutive days the item appears on the menu.
</P>
<P><I>Variable menu item</I> means a standard menu item that comes in different flavors, varieties, or combinations, and is listed as a single menu item.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Requirements for nutrition labeling for food sold in covered establishments</I>—(1) <I>Applicability.</I> (i) The labeling requirements in this paragraph (b) apply to standard menu items offered for sale in covered establishments.
</P>
<P>(ii)(A) The labeling requirements in this paragraph (b) do not apply to foods that are not standard menu items, including:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) Items such as condiments that are for general use, including those placed on the table or on or behind the counter; daily specials; temporary menu items; custom orders; food that is part of a customary market test; and
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) Self-service food and food on display that is offered for sale for less than a total of 60 days per calendar year or fewer than 90 consecutive days in order to test consumer acceptance.
</P>
<P>(B) The labeling requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section do not apply to alcoholic beverages that are foods on display and are not self-service foods.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Nutrition information.</I> (i) Except as provided by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(<I>8</I>) of this section, the following must be provided on menus and menu boards:
</P>
<P>(A) The number of calories contained in each standard menu item listed on the menu or menu board, as usually prepared and offered for sale. In the case of multiple-serving standard menu items, this means the calories declared must be for the whole menu item listed on the menu or menu board as usually prepared and offered for sale (<I>e.g.,</I> “pizza pie: 1600 cal”); or per discrete serving unit as long as the discrete serving unit (<I>e.g.,</I> pizza slice) and total number of discrete serving units contained in the menu item are declared on the menu or menu board, and the menu item is usually prepared and offered for sale divided in discrete serving units (<I>e.g.,</I> “pizza pie: 200 cal/slice, 8 slices”). The calories must be declared in the following manner:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) The number of calories must be listed adjacent to the name or the price of the associated standard menu item, in a type size no smaller than the type size of the name or the price of the associated standard menu item, whichever is smaller, in the same color, or a color at least as conspicuous as that used for the name of the associated standard menu item, and with the same contrasting background or a background at least as contrasting as that used for the name of the associated standard menu item.
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) To the nearest 5-calorie increment up to and including 50 calories and to the nearest 10-calorie increment above 50 calories, except that amounts less than 5 calories may be expressed as zero.
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) The term “Calories” or “Cal” must appear as a heading above a column listing the number of calories for each standard menu item or adjacent to the number of calories for each standard menu item. If the term “Calories” or “Cal” appears as a heading above a column of calorie declarations, the term must be in a type size no smaller than the smallest type size of the name or price of any menu item on that menu or menu board in the same color or a color at least as conspicuous as that used for that name or price and in the same contrasting background or a background at least as contrasting as that used for that name or price. If the term “Calories” or “Cal” appears adjacent to the number of calories for the standard menu item, the term “Calories” or “Cal” must appear in the same type size and in the same color and contrasting background as the number of calories.
</P>
<P>(<I>4</I>) Additional requirements that apply to each individual variable menu item:
</P>
<P>(<I>i</I>) When the menu or menu board lists flavors or varieties of an entire individual variable menu item (such as soft drinks, ice cream, doughnuts, dips, and chicken that can be grilled or fried), the calories must be declared separately for each listed flavor or variety. Where flavors or varieties have the same calorie amounts (after rounding in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(<I>2</I>) of this section), the calorie declaration for such flavors or varieties can be listed as a single calorie declaration adjacent to the flavors or varieties, provided that the calorie declaration specifies that the calorie amount listed represents the calorie amounts for each individual flavor or variety.
</P>
<P>(<I>ii</I>) When the menu or menu board does not list flavors or varieties for an entire individual variable menu item, and only includes a general description of the variable menu item (<I>e.g.,</I> “soft drinks”), the calories must be declared for each option with a slash between the two calorie declarations where only two options are available (<I>e.g.,</I> “150/250 calories”) or as a range in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(7) of this section where more than two options are available (<I>e.g.,</I> “100-250 calories”).
</P>
<P>(<I>iii</I>) When the menu or menu board describes flavors or varieties for only part of an individual variable menu item (such as different types of cheese offered in a grilled cheese sandwich (<I>e.g.,</I> “Grilled Cheese (Cheddar or Swiss)”), the calories must be declared for each option with a slash between the two calorie declarations where only two options are available (<I>e.g.,</I> “450/500 calories”) or as a range in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(<I>7</I>) of this section where more than two options are available (<I>e.g.,</I> “450-550 calories”).
</P>
<P>(<I>5</I>) Additional requirements that apply to a variable menu item that is offered for sale with the option of adding toppings listed on the menu or menu board. When the menu or menu board lists toppings that can be added to a menu item (such as pizza or ice cream):
</P>
<P>(<I>i</I>) The calories must be declared for the basic preparation of the menu item as listed (<I>e.g.,</I> “small pizza pie,” “single scoop ice cream”).
</P>
<P>(<I>ii</I>) The calories must be separately declared for each topping listed on the menu or menu board (<I>e.g.,</I> pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, onions on pizza; fudge, almonds, sprinkles on ice cream), specifying that the calories are added to the calories contained in the basic preparation of the menu item. Where toppings have the same calorie amounts (after rounding in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(<I>2</I>) of this section), the calorie declaration for such toppings can be listed as a single calorie declaration adjacent to the toppings, provided that the calorie declaration specifies that the calorie amount listed represents the calorie amount for each individual topping.
</P>
<P>(<I>iii</I>) The calories for the basic preparation of the menu item must be declared for each size of the menu item. The calories for each topping listed on the menu or menu board must be declared for each size of the menu item, or declared using a slash between the two calorie declarations for each topping where only two sizes of the menu item are available (<I>e.g.,</I> “adds 150/250 cal”) or as a range for each topping in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(<I>7</I>) of this section where more than two sizes of the menu item are available (<I>e.g.,</I> “adds 100-250 cal”). If a slash between two calorie declarations or a range of calorie declarations is used, the menu or menu board must indicate that the variation in calories for each topping arises from the size of the menu item to which the toppings are added.
</P>
<P>(<I>iv</I>) If the amount of the topping included on the basic preparation of the menu item decreases based on the total number of toppings ordered for the menu item (such as is sometimes the case with pizza toppings), the calories for each topping must be declared as single values representing the calories for each topping when added to a one-topping menu item, specifying that the calorie declaration is for the topping when added to a one-topping menu item.
</P>
<P>(<I>6</I>) Additional requirements that apply to a combination meal. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(<I>6</I>)(<I>iv</I>) of this section:
</P>
<P>(<I>i</I>) When the menu or menu board lists two options for menu items in a combination meal (<I>e.g.,</I> a sandwich with a side salad or chips), the calories must be declared for each option with a slash between the two calorie declarations (<I>e.g.,</I> “350/450 calories”).
</P>
<P>(<I>ii</I>) When the menu or menu board lists three or more options for menu items in a combination meal (<I>e.g.,</I> a sandwich with chips, a side salad, or fruit), the calories must be declared as a range in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(<I>7</I>) of this section (<I>e.g.,</I> “350-500 calories”).
</P>
<P>(<I>iii</I>) When the menu or menu board includes a choice to increase or decrease the size of a combination meal, the calorie difference must be declared for the increased or decreased size with a slash between two calorie declarations (<I>e.g.,</I> “Adds 100/150 calories,” “Subtracts 100/150 calories”) if the menu or menu board lists two options for menu items in the combination meal, or as a range in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(<I>7</I>) of this section (<I>e.g.,</I> “Adds 100-250 calories,” “Subtracts 100-250 calories”) if the menu or menu board lists three or more options for menu items in the combination meal.
</P>
<P>(<I>iv</I>) Where the menu or menu board describes an opportunity for a consumer to combine standard menu items for a special price (<I>e.g.,”</I>Combine Any Sandwich with Any Soup or Any Salad for $8.99”), and the calories for each standard menu item, including each size option as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(6)(<I>iii</I>) of this section if applicable, available for the consumer to combine are declared elsewhere on the menu or menu board, the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A)(<I>6</I>)(<I>i</I>), (<I>ii</I>), and (<I>iii</I>) of this section do not apply.
</P>
<P>(<I>7</I>) Additional format requirements for declaring calories for an individual variable menu item, a combination meal, and toppings as a range, if applicable. Calories declared as a range must be in the format “xx-yy,” where “xx” is the caloric content of the lowest calorie variety, flavor, or combination, and “yy” is the caloric content of the highest calorie variety, flavor, or combination.
</P>
<P>(<I>8</I>) Exception for a variable menu item that has no clearly identifiable upper bound to the range of calories: If the variable menu item appears on the menu or menu board and is a self-service food or food on display, and there is no clearly identifiable upper bound to the range, <I>e.g.,</I> all-you-can-eat buffet, then the menu or menu board must include a statement, adjacent to the name or price of the item, referring customers to the self-service facility for calorie information, <I>e.g.,</I> “See buffet for calorie declarations.” This statement must appear in a type size no smaller than the type size of the name or price of the variable menu item, whichever is smaller, and in the same color or a color at least as conspicuous as that used for that name or price, with the same contrasting background or a background at least as contrasting as that used for that name or price.
</P>
<P>(<I>9</I>) Additional requirements that apply to beverages that are not self-service. For beverages that are not self-service, calories must be declared based on the full volume of the cup served without ice, unless the covered establishment ordinarily dispenses and offers for sale a standard beverage fill (<I>i.e.,</I> a fixed amount that is less than the full volume of the cup per cup size) or dispenses a standard ice fill (<I>i.e.,</I> a fixed amount of ice per cup size). If the covered establishment ordinarily dispenses and offers for sale a standard beverage fill or dispenses a standard ice fill, the covered establishment must declare calories based on such standard beverage fill or standard ice fill.
</P>
<P>(B) The following statement designed to enable consumers to understand, in the context of a total daily diet, the significance of the calorie information provided on menus and menu boards: “2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice, but calorie needs vary.” For menus and menu boards targeted to children, the following options may be used as a substitute for or in addition to the succinct statement: “1,200 to 1,400 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice for children ages 4 to 8 years, but calorie needs vary.” or “1,200 to 1,400 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice for children ages 4 to 8 years and 1,400 to 2,000 calories a day for children ages 9 to 13 years, but calorie needs vary.”
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) This statement must be posted prominently and in a clear and conspicuous manner in a type size no smaller than the smallest type size of any calorie declaration appearing on the same menu or menu board and in the same color or in a color at least as conspicuous as that used for the calorie declarations and with the same contrasting background or a background at least as contrasting as that used for the calorie declarations.
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) For menus, this statement must appear on the bottom of each page of the menu. On menu pages that also bear the statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, this statement must appear immediately above, below, or beside the statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section.
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) For menu boards, this statement must appear on the bottom of the menu board, immediately above, below, or beside the statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section.
</P>
<P>(C) The following statement regarding the availability of the additional written nutrition information required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section must be on all forms of the menu or menu board: “Additional nutrition information available upon request.”
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) This statement must be posted prominently and in a clear and conspicuous manner in a type size no smaller than the smallest type size of any calorie declaration appearing on the same menu or menu board and in the same color or in a color at least as conspicuous as that used for the caloric declarations, and with the same contrasting background or a background at least as contrasting as that used for the caloric declarations.
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) For menus, the statement must appear on the bottom of the first page with menu items immediately above, below, or beside the succinct statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) For menu boards, the statement must appear on the bottom of the menu board immediately above, below, or beside the succinct statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) The following nutrition information for a standard menu item must be available in written form on the premises of the covered establishment and provided to the customer upon request. This nutrition information must be presented in the order listed and using the measurements listed, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. Rounding of these nutrients must be in compliance with § 101.9(c). The information must be presented in a clear and conspicuous manner, including using a color, type size, and contrasting background that render the information likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use. Covered establishments may use the abbreviations allowed for Nutrition Facts for certain packaged foods in § 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B):
</P>
<P>(A)(<I>1</I>) Total calories (cal);
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) Calories from fat (fat cal);
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) Total fat (g);
</P>
<P>(<I>4</I>) Saturated fat (g);

</P>
<P>(<I>10</I>) Sugars (g); and
</P>
<P>(<I>11</I>) Protein (g).
</P>
<P>(B) If a standard menu item contains insignificant amounts of all the nutrients required to be disclosed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the establishment is not required to include nutrition information regarding the standard menu item in the written form. However, if the covered establishment makes a nutrient content claim or health claim, the establishment is required to provide nutrition information on the nutrient that is the subject of the claim in accordance with § 101.10. For standard menu items that contain insignificant amounts of six or more of the required nutrients, the declaration of nutrition information required by paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section may be presented in a simplified format.
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) An insignificant amount is defined as that amount that allows a declaration of zero in nutrition labeling, except that for total carbohydrates, dietary fiber, and protein, it must be an amount that allows a declaration of “less than one gram.”
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) The simplified format must include information, in a column, list, or table, on the following nutrients:
</P>
<P>(<I>i</I>) Total calories, total fat, total carbohydrates, protein, and sodium; and
</P>
<P>(<I>ii</I>) Calories from fat, and any other nutrients identified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section that are present in more than insignificant amounts.
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) If the simplified format is used, the statement “Not a significant source of ____” (with the blank filled in with the names of the nutrients required to be declared in the written nutrient information and calories from fat that are present in insignificant amounts) must be included at the bottom of the list of nutrients.
</P>
<P>(C) For variable menu items, the nutrition information listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section must be declared as follows for each size offered for sale:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) The nutrition information required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section must be declared for the basic preparation of the item and, separately, for each topping, flavor, or variable component.
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) Additional format requirements for toppings if the amount of the topping included on the basic preparation of the menu item decreases based on the total number of toppings ordered for the menu item (such as is sometimes the case with pizza toppings). The nutrients for such topping must be declared as single values representing the nutrients for each topping when added to a one-topping menu item, specifying that the nutrient declaration is for the topping when added to a one-topping menu item.
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) If the calories and other nutrients are the same for different flavors, varieties, and variable components of the combination meal, each variety, flavor, and variable component of the combination meal is not required to be listed separately. All items that have the same nutrient values could be listed together with the nutrient values listed only once.
</P>
<P>(D) The written nutrition information required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section may be provided on a counter card, sign, poster, handout, booklet, loose leaf binder, or electronic device such as a computer, or in a menu, or in any other form that similarly permits the written declaration of the required nutrient content information for all standard menu items. If the written nutrition information is not in a form that can be given to the customer upon request, it must be readily available in a manner and location on the premises that allows the customer/consumer to review the written nutrition information upon request.
</P>
<P>(iii) The following must be provided for a standard menu item that is self-service or on display.
</P>
<P>(A) Calories per displayed food item (<I>e.g.,</I> a bagel, a slice of pizza, or a muffin), or if the food is not offered for sale in a discrete unit, calories per serving (<I>e.g.,</I> scoop, cup), and the serving or discrete unit used to determine the calorie content (<I>e.g.,</I> “per scoop” or “per muffin”) on either: A sign adjacent to and clearly associated with the corresponding food; (<I>e.g.,</I> “150 calories per scoop); a sign attached to a sneeze guard with the calorie declaration and the serving or unit used to determine the calorie content above each specific food so that the consumer can clearly associate the calorie declaration with the food, except that if it is not clear to which food the calorie declaration and serving or unit refers, then the sign must also include the name of the food, <I>e.g.,</I> “Broccoli and cheese casserole—200 calories per scoop”; or a single sign or placard listing the calorie declaration for several food items along with the names of the food items, so long as the sign or placard is located where a consumer can view the name, calorie declaration, and serving or unit of a particular item while selecting that item.
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, “per displayed food item”; means per each discrete unit offered for sale, for example, a bagel, a slice of pizza, or a muffin.
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, “per serving” means, for each food:
</P>
<P>(<I>i</I>) Per serving instrument used to dispense the food offered for sale, provided that the serving instrument dispenses a uniform amount of the food (<I>e.g.,</I> a scoop or ladle);
</P>
<P>(<I>ii</I>) If a serving instrument that dispenses a uniform amount of food is not used to dispense the food, per each common household measure (<I>e.g.,</I> cup or tablespoon) offered for sale or per unit of weight offered for sale, <I>e.g.,</I> per quarter pound or per 4 ounces; or
</P>
<P>(<I>iii</I>) Per total number of fluid ounces in the cup in which a self-service beverage is served and, if applicable, the description of the cup size (<I>e.g.,</I> “140 calories per 12 fluid ounces (small)”).
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) The calories must be declared in the following manner:
</P>
<P>(<I>i</I>) To the nearest 5-calorie increment up to and including 50 calories and to the nearest 10-calorie increment above 50 calories except that amounts less than 5 calories may be expressed as zero.
</P>
<P>(<I>ii</I>) If the calorie declaration is provided on a sign with the food's name, price, or both, the calorie declaration, accompanied by the term “Calories” or “Cal” and the amount of the serving or displayed food item on which the calories declaration is based must be in a type size no smaller than the type size of the name or price of the menu item whichever is smaller, in the same color, or a color that is at least as conspicuous as that used for that name or price, using the same contrasting background or a background at least as contrasting as that used for that name or price. If the calorie declaration is provided on a sign that does not include the food's name, price, or both, the calorie declaration, accompanied by the term “Calories” or “Cal” and the amount of the serving or displayed food item on which the calorie declaration is based must be clear and conspicuous.
</P>
<P>(<I>iii</I>) For self-service beverages, calorie declarations must be accompanied by the term “fluid ounces” and, if applicable, the description of the cup size (<I>e.g.,</I> “small,” “medium”).
</P>
<P>(B) For food that is self-service or on display and is identified by an individual sign adjacent to the food itself where such sign meets the definition of a menu or menu board under paragraph (a) of this section, the statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section and the statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section. These two statements may appear on the sign adjacent to the food itself; on a separate, larger sign, in close proximity to the food that can be easily read as the consumer is making order selections; or on a large menu board that can be easily read as the consumer is viewing the food.
</P>
<P>(C) The nutrition information in written form required by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, except for packaged food insofar as it bears nutrition labeling information required by and in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section and the packaged food, including its label, can be examined by a consumer before purchasing the food.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Determination of nutrient content.</I> (1) A covered establishment must have a reasonable basis for its nutrient declarations. Nutrient values may be determined by using nutrient databases (with or without computer software programs), cookbooks, laboratory analyses, or other reasonable means, including the use of Nutrition Facts on labels on packaged foods that comply with the nutrition labeling requirements of section 403(q)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and § 101.9, FDA nutrient values for raw fruits and vegetables in Appendix C of this part, or FDA nutrient values for cooked fish in Appendix D of this part.
</P>
<P>(2) Nutrient declarations for standard menu items must be accurate and consistent with the specific basis used to determine nutrient values. A covered establishment must take reasonable steps to ensure that the method of preparation (<I>e.g.,</I> types and amounts of ingredients, cooking temperatures) and amount of a standard menu item offered for sale adhere to the factors on which its nutrient values were determined.

<HEAD>§ 101.12   Reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The general principles and factors that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considered in arriving at the reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion (reference amounts) which are set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, are that:
</P>
<P>(1) FDA calculated the reference amounts for persons 4 years of age or older to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons in this population group. These reference amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys.
</P>
<P>(2) FDA calculated the reference amounts for an infant or child under 4 years of age to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively. These reference amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys. Such reference amounts are to be used only when the food is specially formulated or processed for use by an infant or by a child under 4 years of age.
</P>
<P>(3) An appropriate national food consumption survey includes a large sample size representative of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the relevant population group and must be based on consumption data under actual conditions of use.
</P>
<P>(4) To determine the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion, FDA considered the mean, median, and mode of the consumed amount per eating occasion.
</P>
<P>(5) When survey data were insufficient, FDA took various other sources of information on serving sizes of food into consideration. These other sources of information included:
</P>
<P>(i) Serving sizes used in dietary guidance recommendations or recommended by other authoritative systems or organizations;
</P>
<P>(ii) Serving sizes recommended in comments;
</P>
<P>(iii) Serving sizes used by manufacturers and grocers; and
</P>
<P>(iv) Serving sizes used by other countries.
</P>
<P>(6) Because they reflect the amount customarily consumed, the reference amount and, in turn, the serving size declared on the product label are based on only the edible portion of food, and not bone, seed, shell, or other inedible components.
</P>
<P>(7) The reference amount is based on the major intended use of the food (e.g., milk as a beverage and not as an addition to cereal).
</P>
<P>(8) The reference amounts for products that are consumed as an ingredient of other foods, but that may also be consumed in the form in which they are purchased (e.g., butter), are based on use in the form purchased.
</P>
<P>(9) FDA sought to ensure that foods that have similar dietary usage, product characteristics, and customarily consumed amounts have a uniform reference amount.
</P>
<P>(b) The following reference amounts shall be used as the basis for determining serving sizes for specific products:

<P>(c) If a product requires further preparation, <I>e.g.,</I> cooking or the addition of water or other ingredients, and if paragraph (b) of this section provides a reference amount for the product in the prepared form, but not the unprepared form, then the reference amount for the unprepared product must be the amount of the unprepared product required to make the reference amount for the prepared product as established in paragraph (b) of this section.
</P>
<P>(d) The reference amount for an imitation or substitute food or altered food, such as a “low calorie” version, shall be the same as for the food for which it is offered as a substitute.
</P>
<P>(e) If a food is modified by incorporating air (aerated), and thereby the density of the food is lowered by 25 percent or more in weight than that of an appropriate reference regular food as described in § 101.13(j)(1)(ii)(A), and the reference amount of the regular food is in grams, the manufacturer may determine the reference amount of the aerated food by adjusting for the difference in density of the aerated food relative to the density of the appropriate reference food provided that the manufacturer will show FDA detailed protocol and records of all data that were used to determine the density-adjusted reference amount for the aerated food. The reference amount for the aerated food shall be rounded to the nearest 5-g increment. Such products shall bear a descriptive term indicating that extra air has been incorporated (e.g., whipped, aerated). The density-adjusted reference amounts described in paragraph (b) of this section may not be used for cakes except for cheese cake. The differences in the densities of different types of cakes having different degrees of air incorporation have already been taken into consideration in determining the reference amounts for cakes in § 101.12(b). In determining the difference in density of the aerated and the regular food, the manufacturer shall adhere to the following:
</P>
<P>(1) The regular and the aerated product must be the same in size, shape, and volume. To compare the densities of products having nonsmooth surfaces (e.g., waffles), manufacturers shall use a device or method that ensures that the volumes of the regular and the aerated products are the same.
</P>
<P>(2) Sample selections for the density measurements shall be done in accordance with the provisions in § 101.9(g).
</P>
<P>(3) Density measurements of the regular and the aerated products shall be conducted by the same trained operator using the same methodology (e.g., the same equipment, procedures, and techniques) under the same conditions.
</P>
<P>(4) Density measurements shall be replicated a sufficient number of times to ensure that the average of the measurements is representative of the true differences in the densities of the regular and the “aerated” products.
</P>
<P>(f) For products that have no reference amount listed in paragraph (b) of this section for the unprepared or the prepared form of the product and that consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together (e.g., peanut butter and jelly, cracker and cheese pack, pancakes and syrup, cake and frosting), the reference amount for the combined product shall be determined using the following rules:
</P>
<P>(1) The reference amount for the combined product must be the reference amount, as established in paragraph (b) of this section, for the ingredient that is represented as the main ingredient (<I>e.g.,</I> peanut butter, pancakes, cake) plus proportioned amounts of all minor ingredients.
</P>
<P>(2) If the reference amounts are in compatible units, the weights or volumes must be summed (<I>e.g.,</I> the reference amount for equal volumes of peanut butter and jelly for which peanut butter is represented as the main ingredient would be 4 tablespoons (tbsp) (2 tbsp peanut butter plus 2 tbsp jelly)). If the reference amounts are in incompatible units, all amounts must be converted to weights and summed, <I>e.g.,</I> the reference amount for pancakes and syrup would be 110 g (the reference amount for pancakes) plus the weight of the proportioned amount of syrup.
</P>
<P>(g) The reference amounts set forth in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section shall be used in determining whether a product meets the criteria for nutrient content claims, such as “low calorie,” and for health claims. If the serving size declared on the product label differs from the reference amount, and the product meets the criteria for the claim only on the basis of the reference amount, the claim shall be followed by a statement that sets forth the basis on which the claim is made. That statement shall include the reference amount as it appears in paragraph (b) of this section followed, in parenthesis, by the amount in common household measure if the reference amount is expressed in measures other than common household measures (e.g., for a beverage, “Very low sodium, 35 mg or less per 240 mL (8 fl oz)”).
</P>
<P>(h) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, either on his or her own initiative or in response to a petition submitted pursuant to part 10 of this chapter, may issue a proposal to establish or amend a reference amount in paragraph (b) of this section. A petition to establish or amend a reference amount shall include:
</P>
<P>(1) Objective of the petition;
</P>
<P>(2) A description of the product;
</P>
<P>(3) A complete sample product label including nutrition label, using the format established by regulation;
</P>
<P>(4) A description of the form (e.g., dry mix, frozen dough) in which the product will be marketed;
</P>
<P>(5) The intended dietary uses of the product with the major use identified (e.g., milk as a beverage and chips as a snack);
</P>
<P>(6) If the intended use is primarily as an ingredient in other foods, list of foods or food categories in which the product will be used as an ingredient with information on the prioritization of the use;
</P>
<P>(7) The population group for which the product will be offered for use (e.g., infants, children under 4 years of age);
</P>
<P>(8) The names of the most closely related products (or in the case of foods for special dietary use and imitation or substitute foods, the names of the products for which they are offered as substitutes);
</P>
<P>(9) The suggested reference amount (the amount of edible portion of food as consumed, excluding bone, seed, shell, or other inedible components) for the population group for which the product is intended with full description of the methodology and procedures that were used to determine the suggested reference amount. In determining the reference amount, general principles and factors in paragraph (a) of this section should be followed.
</P>
<P>(10) The suggested reference amount shall be expressed in metric units. Reference amounts for fluids shall be expressed in milliliters. Reference amounts for other foods shall be expressed in grams except when common household units such as cups, tablespoons, and teaspoons, are more appropriate or are more likely to promote uniformity in serving sizes declared on product labels. For example, common household measures would be more appropriate if products within the same category differ substantially in density, such as frozen desserts.
</P>
<P>(i) In expressing the reference amounts in milliliters, the following rules shall be followed:
</P>
<P>(A) For volumes greater than 30 milliliters (mL), the volume shall be expressed in multiples of 30 mL.
</P>
<P>(B) For volumes less than 30 mL, the volume shall be expressed in milliliters equivalent to a whole number of teaspoons or 1 tbsp, i.e., 5, 10, or 15 mL.
</P>
<P>(ii) In expressing the reference amounts in grams, the following general rules shall be followed:
</P>
<P>(A) For quantities greater than 10 g, the quantity shall be expressed in the nearest 5-g increment.
</P>
<P>(B) For quantities less than 10 g, exact gram weights shall be used.
</P>
<P>(11) A petition to create a new subcategory of food with its own reference amount shall include the following additional information:
</P>
<P>(i) Data that demonstrate that the new subcategory of food will be consumed in amounts that differ enough from the reference amount for the parent category to warrant a separate reference amount. Data must include sample size; and the mean, standard deviation, median, and modal consumed amount per eating occasion for the petitioned product and for other products in the category, excluding the petitioned product. All data must be derived from the same survey data.
</P>
<P>(ii) Documentation supporting the difference in dietary usage and product characteristics that affect the consumption size that distinguishes the petitioned product from the rest of the products in the category.
</P>
<P>(12) A claim for categorical exclusion under § 25.30 or § 25.32 of this chapter or an environmental assessment under § 25.40 of this chapter, and
</P>
<P>(13) In conducting research to collect or process food consumption data in support of the petition, the following general guidelines should be followed.
</P>
<P>(i) Sampled population selected should be representative of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the target population group for which the food is intended.
</P>
<P>(ii) Sample size (i.e., number of eaters) should be large enough to give reliable estimates for customarily consumed amounts.
</P>
<P>(iii) The study protocol should identify potential biases and describe how potential biases are controlled for or, if not possible to control, how they affect interpretation of results.
</P>
<P>(iv) The methodology used to collect or process data should be fully documented and should include: study design, sampling procedures, materials used (e.g., questionnaire, and interviewer's manual), procedures used to collect or process data, methods or procedures used to control for unbiased estimates, and procedures used to correct for nonresponse.
</P>
<P>(14) A statement concerning the feasibility of convening associations, corporations, consumers, and other interested parties to engage in negotiated rulemaking to develop a proposed rule consistent with the Negotiated Rulemaking Act (5 U.S.C. 561).

<DIV8 N="101.13" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="2">
<HEAD>§ 101.13   Nutrient content claims—general principles.</HEAD>
<P>(a) This section and the regulations in subpart D of this part apply to foods that are intended for human consumption and that are offered for sale, including conventional foods and dietary supplements.
</P>
<P>(b) A claim that expressly or implicitly characterizes the level of a nutrient of the type required to be in nutrition labeling under § 101.9 or under § 101.36 (that is, a nutrient content claim) may not be made on the label or in labeling of foods unless the claim is made in accordance with this regulation and with the applicable regulations in subpart D of this part or in part 105 or part 107 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(1) An expressed nutrient content claim is any direct statement about the level (or range) of a nutrient in the food, e.g., “low sodium” or “contains 100 calories.”
</P>
<P>(2) An implied nutrient content claim is any claim that:
</P>
<P>(i) Describes the food or an ingredient therein in a manner that suggests that a nutrient is absent or present in a certain amount (e.g., “high in oat bran”); or
</P>
<P>(ii) Suggests that the food, because of its nutrient content, may be useful in maintaining healthy dietary practices and is made in association with an explicit claim or statement about a nutrient (e.g., “healthy, contains 3 grams (g) of fat”).
</P>
<P>(3) Except for claims regarding vitamins and minerals described in paragraph (q)(3) of this section, no nutrient content claims may be made on food intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age unless the claim is specifically provided for in parts 101, 105, or 107 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(4) Reasonable variations in the spelling of the terms defined in part 101 and their synonyms are permitted provided these variations are not misleading (e.g., “hi” or “lo”).
</P>
<P>(5) For dietary supplements, claims for calories, fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol may not be made on products that meet the criteria in § 101.60(b)(1) or (b)(2) for “calorie free” or “low calorie” claims, except, in the case of calorie claims, when an equivalent amount of a similar dietary supplement (e.g., another protein supplement) that the labeled food resembles and for which it substitutes, normally exceeds the definition for “low calorie” in § 101.60(b)(2).
</P>
<P>(c) Information that is required or permitted by § 101.9 or § 101.36, as applicable, to be declared in nutrition labeling, and that appears as part of the nutrition label, is not a nutrient content claim and is not subject to the requirements of this section. If such information is declared elsewhere on the label or in labeling, it is a nutrient content claim and is subject to the requirements for nutrient content claims.
</P>
<P>(d) A “substitute” food is one that may be used interchangeably with another food that it resembles, i.e., that it is organoleptically, physically, and functionally (including shelf life) similar to, and that it is not nutritionally inferior to unless it is labeled as an “imitation.”
</P>
<P>(1) If there is a difference in performance characteristics that materially limits the use of the food, the food may still be considered a substitute if the label includes a disclaimer adjacent to the most prominent claim as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section, informing the consumer of such difference (e.g., “not recommended for frying”).
</P>
<P>(2) This disclaimer shall be in easily legible print or type and in a size no less than that required by § 101.7(i) for the net quantity of contents statement, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclaimer shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than one-sixteenth of an inch, unless the package complies with § 101.2(c)(5), in which case the disclaimer may be in type of not less than one thirty-second of an inch.
</P>
<P>(e)(1) Because the use of a “free” or “low” claim before the name of a food implies that the food differs from other foods of the same type by virtue of its having a lower amount of the nutrient, only foods that have been specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated so as to lower the amount of the nutrient in the food, remove the nutrient from the food, or not include the nutrient in the food, may bear such a claim (e.g., “low sodium potato chips”).
</P>
<P>(2) Any claim for the absence of a nutrient in a food, or that a food is low in a nutrient when the food has not been specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated to qualify for that claim shall indicate that the food inherently meets the criteria and shall clearly refer to all foods of that type and not merely to the particular brand to which the labeling attaches (e.g., “corn oil, a sodium-free food”).
</P>
<P>(f) A nutrient content claim shall be in type size no larger than two times the statement of identity and shall not be unduly prominent in type style compared to the statement of identity.
</P>
<P>(g) [Reserved]
</P>
<P>(h)(1) If a food, except a meal product as defined in § 101.13(l), a main dish product as defined in § 101.13(m), or food intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age, contains more than 13.0 g of fat, 4.0 g of saturated fat, 60 milligrams (mg) of cholesterol, or 480 mg of sodium per reference amount customarily consumed, per labeled serving, or, for a food with a reference amount customarily consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less, per 50 g (for dehydrated foods that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant amount, as defined in § 101.9(f)(1), of all nutrients per reference amount customarily consumed, the per 50 g criterion refers to the “as prepared” form), then that food must bear a statement disclosing that the nutrient exceeding the specified level is present in the food as follows: “See nutrition information for ____ content” with the blank filled in with the identity of the nutrient exceeding the specified level, e.g., “See nutrition information for fat content.”
</P>
<P>(2) If a food is a meal product as defined in § 101.13(l), and contains more than 26 g of fat, 8.0 g of saturated fat, 120 mg of cholesterol, or 960 mg of sodium per labeled serving, then that food must disclose, in accordance with the requirements as provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, that the nutrient exceeding the specified level is present in the food.
</P>
<P>(3) If a food is a main dish product as defined in § 101.13(m), and contains more than 19.5 g of fat, 6.0 g of saturated fat, 90 mg of cholesterol, or 720 mg of sodium per labeled serving, then that food must disclose, in accordance with the requirements as provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, that the nutrient exceeding the specified level is present in the food.
</P>
<P>(4)(i) The disclosure statement “See nutrition information for ____ content” shall be in easily legible boldface print or type, in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, and in a size no less than that required by § 101.7(i) for the net quantity of contents statement, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclosure statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than one-sixteenth of an inch, unless the package complies with § 101.2(c)(2), in which case the disclosure statement may be in type of not less than one thirty-second of an inch.
</P>
<P>(ii) The disclosure statement shall be immediately adjacent to the nutrient content claim and may have no intervening material other than, if applicable, other information in the statement of identity or any other information that is required to be presented with the claim under this section (e.g., see paragraph (j)(2) of this section) or under a regulation in subpart D of this part (e.g., see §§ 101.54 and 101.62). If the nutrient content claim appears on more than one panel of the label, the disclosure statement shall be adjacent to the claim on each panel except for the panel that bears the nutrition information where it may be omitted.
</P>
<P>(iii) If a single panel of a food label or labeling contains multiple nutrient content claims or a single claim repeated several times, a single disclosure statement may be made. The statement shall be adjacent to the claim that is printed in the largest type on that panel.
</P>
<P>(i) Except as provided in § 101.9 or § 101.36, as applicable, or in paragraph (q)(3) of this section, the label or labeling of a product may contain a statement about the amount or percentage of a nutrient if:
</P>
<P>(1) The use of the statement on the food implicitly characterizes the level of the nutrient in the food and is consistent with a definition for a claim, as provided in subpart D of this part, for the nutrient that the label addresses. Such a claim might be, “less than 3 g of fat per serving;”
</P>
<P>(2) The use of the statement on the food implicitly characterizes the level of the nutrient in the food and is not consistent with such a definition, but the label carries a disclaimer adjacent to the statement that the food is not “low” in or a “good source” of the nutrient, such as “only 200 mg sodium per serving, not a low sodium food.” The disclaimer must be in easily legible print or type and in a size no less than that required by § 101.7(i) for the net quantity of contents statement except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclaimer shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than one-sixteenth of an inch unless the package complies with § 101.2(c)(5), in which case the disclaimer may be in type of not less than one thirty-second of an inch, or
</P>
<P>(3) The statement does not in any way implicitly characterize the level of the nutrient in the food and it is not false or misleading in any respect (e.g., “100 calories” or “5 grams of fat”), in which case no disclaimer is required.
</P>
<P>(4) “Percent fat free” claims are not authorized by this paragraph. Such claims shall comply with § 101.62(b)(6).
</P>
<P>(j) A food may bear a statement that compares the level of a nutrient in the food with the level of a nutrient in a reference food. These statements shall be known as “relative claims” and include “light,” “reduced,” “less” (or “fewer”), and “more” claims.
</P>
<P>(1) To bear a relative claim about the level of a nutrient, the amount of that nutrient in the food must be compared to an amount of nutrient in an appropriate reference food as specified below.
</P>
<P>(i)(A) For “less” (or “fewer”) and “more” claims, the reference food may be a dissimilar food within a product category that can generally be substituted for one another in the diet (e.g., potato chips as reference for pretzels, orange juice as a reference for vitamin C tablets) or a similar food (e.g., potato chips as reference for potato chips, one brand of multivitamin as reference for another brand of multivitamin).
</P>
<P>(B) For “light,” “reduced,” “added,” “extra,” “plus,” “fortified,” and “enriched” claims, the reference food shall be a similar food (e.g., potato chips as a reference for potato chips, one brand of multivitamin for another brand of multivitamin), and 
</P>
<P>(ii)(A) For “light” claims, the reference food shall be representative of the type of food that includes the product that bears the claim. The nutrient value for the reference food shall be representative of a broad base of foods of that type; e.g., a value in a representative, valid data base; an average value determined from the top three national (or regional) brands, a market basket norm; or, where its nutrient value is representative of the food type, a market leader. Firms using such a reference nutrient value as a basis for a claim, are required to provide specific information upon which the nutrient value was derived, on request, to consumers and appropriate regulatory officials.
</P>
<P>(B) For relative claims other than “light,” including “less” and “more” claims, the reference food may be the same as that provided for “light” in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, or it may be the manufacturer's regular product, or that of another manufacturer, that has been offered for sale to the public on a regular basis for a substantial period of time in the same geographic area by the same business entity or by one entitled to use its trade name. The nutrient values used to determine the claim when comparing a single manufacturer's product to the labeled product shall be either the values declared in nutrition labeling or the actual nutrient values, provided that the resulting label is internally consistent to (i.e., that the values stated in the nutrition information, the nutrient values in the accompanying information and the declaration of the percentage of nutrient by which the food has been modified are consistent and will not cause consumer confusion when compared), and that the actual modification is at least equal to the percentage specified in the definition of the claim.
</P>
<P>(2) For foods bearing relative claims:
</P>
<P>(i) The label or labeling must state the identity of the reference food and the percentage (or fraction) of the amount of the nutrient in the reference food by which the nutrient in the labeled food differs (e.g., “50 percent less fat than (reference food)” or “1/3 fewer calories than (reference food)”),
</P>
<P>(ii) This information shall be immediately adjacent to the most prominent claim. The type size shall be in accordance with paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section.
</P>
<P>(iii) The determination of which use of the claim is in the most prominent location on the label or labeling will be made based on the following factors, considered in order:
</P>
<P>(A) A claim on the principal display panel adjacent to the statement of identity;
</P>
<P>(B) A claim elsewhere on the principal display panel;
</P>
<P>(C) A claim on the information panel; or
</P>
<P>(D) A claim elsewhere on the label or labeling.
</P>
<P>(iv) The label or labeling must also bear:
</P>
<P>(A) Clear and concise quantitative information comparing the amount of the subject nutrient in the product per labeled serving with that in the reference food; and
</P>
<P>(B) This statement shall appear adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.
</P>
<P>(3) A relative claim for decreased levels of a nutrient may not be made on the label or in labeling of a food if the nutrient content of the reference food meets the requirement for a “low” claim for that nutrient (e.g., 3 g fat or less).
</P>
<P>(k) The term “modified” may be used in the statement of identity of a food that bears a relative claim that complies with the requirements of this part, followed immediately by the name of the nutrient whose content has been altered (e.g., “Modified fat cheesecake”). This statement of identity must be immediately followed by the comparative statement such as “Contains 35 percent less fat than ______.” The label or labeling must also bear the information required by paragraph (j)(2) of this section in the manner prescribed.
</P>
<P>(l) For purposes of making a claim, a “meal product shall be defined as a food that:
</P>
<P>(1) Makes a major contribution to the total diet by:
</P>
<P>(i) Weighing at least 10 ounces (oz) per labeled serving; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Containing not less than three 40-g portions of food, or combinations of foods, from two or more of the following four food groups, except as noted in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(E) of this section.
</P>
<P>(A) Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group;
</P>
<P>(B) Fruits and vegetables group;
</P>
<P>(C) Milk, yogurt, and cheese group;
</P>
<P>(D) Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts group; except that;
</P>
<P>(E) These foods shall not be sauces (except for foods in the above four food groups that are in the sauces), gravies, condiments, relishes, pickles, olives, jams, jellies, syrups, breadings or garnishes; and
</P>
<P>(2) Is represented as, or is in a form commonly understood to be, a breakfast, lunch, dinner, or meal. Such representations may be made either by statements, photographs, or vignettes.
</P>
<P>(m) For purposes of making a claim, a “main dish product” shall be defined as a food that:
</P>
<P>(1) Makes a major contribution to a meal by
</P>
<P>(i) Weighing at least 6 oz per labeled serving; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Containing not less than 40 g of food, or combinations of foods, from each of at least two of the following four food groups, except as noted in paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(E) of this section.
</P>
<P>(A) Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group;
</P>
<P>(B) Fruits and vegetables group;
</P>
<P>(C) Milk, yogurt, and cheese group;
</P>
<P>(D) Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts groups; except that:
</P>
<P>(E) These foods shall not be sauces (except for foods in the above four food groups that are in the sauces) gravies, condiments, relishes, pickles, olives, jams, jellies, syrups, breadings, or garnishes; and
</P>
<P>(2) Is represented as, or is in a form commonly understood to be, a main dish (e.g., not a beverage or a dessert). Such representations may be made either by statements, photographs, or vignettes.
</P>
<P>(n) Nutrition labeling in accordance with § 101.9, § 101.10, or § 101.36, as applicable, shall be provided for any food for which a nutrient content claim is made.
</P>
<P>(o) Except as provided in § 101.10, compliance with requirements for nutrient content claims in this section and in the regulations in subpart D of this part, will be determined using the analytical methodology prescribed for determining compliance with nutrition labeling in § 101.9.
</P>
<P>(p)(1) Unless otherwise specified, the reference amount customarily consumed set forth in § 101.12(b) through (f) shall be used in determining whether a product meets the criteria for a nutrient content claim. If the serving size declared on the product label differs from the reference amount customarily consumed, and the amount of the nutrient contained in the labeled serving does not meet the maximum or minimum amount criterion in the definition for the descriptor for that nutrient, the claim shall be followed by the criteria for the claim as required by § 101.12(g) (e.g., “very low sodium, 35 mg or less per 240 milliliters (8 fl oz.)”).
</P>
<P>(2) The criteria for the claim shall be immediately adjacent to the most prominent claim in easily legible print or type and in a size in accordance with paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section.
</P>
<P>(q) The following exemptions apply:
</P>
<P>(1) Nutrient content claims that have not been defined by regulation and that are contained in the brand name of a specific food product that was the brand name in use on such food before October 25, 1989, may continue to be used as part of that brand name for such product, provided that they are not false or misleading under section 403(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). However, foods bearing such claims must comply with section 403(f), (g), and (h) of the act;
</P>
<P>(2) A soft drink that used the term <I>diet</I> as part of its brand name before October 25, 1989, and whose use of that term was in compliance with § 105.66 of this chapter as that regulation appeared in the Code of Federal Regulations on that date, may continue to use that term as part of its brand name, provided that its use of the term is not false or misleading under section 403(a) of the act. Such claims are exempt from the requirements of section 403(r)(2) of the act (e.g., the disclosure statement also required by § 101.13(h)). Soft drinks marketed after October 25, 1989, may use the term “diet” provided they are in compliance with the current § 105.66 of this chapter and the requirements of § 101.13.
</P>
<P>(3)(i) A statement that describes the percentage of a vitamin or mineral in the food, including foods intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age, in relation to a Reference Daily Intake (RDI) as defined in § 101.9 may be made on the label or in labeling of a food without a regulation authorizing such a claim for a specific vitamin or mineral unless such claim is expressly prohibited by regulation under section 403(r)(2)(A)(vi) of the act.
</P>
<P>(ii) Percentage claims for dietary supplements. Under section 403(r)(2)(F) of the act, a statement that characterizes the percentage level of a dietary ingredient for which a reference daily intake (RDI) or daily reference value (DRV) has not been established may be made on the label or in labeling of dietary supplements without a regulation that specifically defines such a statement. All such claims shall be accompanied by any disclosure statement required under paragraph (h) of this section.
</P>
<P>(A) <I>Simple percentage claims.</I> Whenever a statement is made that characterizes the percentage level of a dietary ingredient for which there is no RDI or DRV, the statement of the actual amount of the dietary ingredient per serving shall be declared next to the percentage statement (e.g., “40 percent omega-3 fatty acids, 10 mg per capsule”).
</P>
<P>(B) <I>Comparative percentage claims.</I> Whenever a statement is made that characterizes the percentage level of a dietary ingredient for which there is no RDI or DRV and the statement draws a comparison to the amount of the dietary ingredient in a reference food, the reference food shall be clearly identified, the amount of that food shall be identified, and the information on the actual amount of the dietary ingredient in both foods shall be declared in accordance with paragraph (j)(2)(iv) of this section (e.g., “twice the omega-3 fatty acids per capsule (80 mg) as in 100 mg of menhaden oil (40 mg)”).
</P>
<P>(4) The requirements of this section do not apply to:
</P>
<P>(i) Infant formulas subject to section 412(h) of the act; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Medical foods defined by section 5(b) of the Orphan Drug Act.
</P>
<P>(5) A nutrient content claim used on food that is served in restaurants or other establishments in which food is served for immediate human consumption or which is sold for sale or use in such establishments shall comply with the requirements of this section and the appropriate definition in subpart D of this part, except that:
</P>
<P>(i) Such claim is exempt from the requirements for disclosure statements in paragraph (h) of this section and §§ 101.54(d), 101.62(c), (d)(1)(ii)(D), (d)(2)(iii)(C), (d)(3), (d)(4)(ii)(C), and (d)(5)(ii)(C); and
</P>
<P>(ii) In lieu of analytical testing, compliance may be determined using a reasonable basis for concluding that the food that bears the claim meets the definition for the claim. This reasonable basis may derive from recognized data bases for raw and processed foods, recipes, and other means to compute nutrient levels in the foods or meals and may be used provided reasonable steps are taken to ensure that the method of preparation adheres to the factors on which the reasonable basis was determined (e.g., types and amounts of ingredients, cooking temperatures, etc.). Firms making claims on foods based on this reasonable basis criterion are required to provide to appropriate regulatory officials on request the specific information on which their determination is based and reasonable assurance of operational adherence to the preparation methods or other basis for the claim; and
</P>
<P>(iii) A term or symbol that may in some contexts constitute a claim under this section may be used, provided that the use of the term or symbol does not characterize the level of a nutrient, and a statement that clearly explains the basis for the use of the term or symbol is prominently displayed and does not characterize the level of a nutrient. For example, a term such as “lite fare” followed by an asterisk referring to a note that makes clear that in this restaurant “lite fare” means smaller portion sizes than normal; or an item bearing a symbol referring to a note that makes clear that this item meets the criteria for the dietary guidance established by a recognized dietary authority would not be considered a nutrient content claim under § 101.13.
</P>
<P>(6) Nutrient content claims that were part of the common or usual names of foods that were subject to a standard of identity on November 8, 1990, are not subject to the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (h) of this section or to definitions in subpart D of this part.
</P>
<P>(7) Implied nutrient content claims may be used as part of a brand name, provided that the use of the claim has been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration. Petitions requesting approval of such a claim may be submitted under § 101.69(o).
</P>
<P>(8) The term <I>fluoridated, fluoride added</I> or <I>with added fluoride</I> may be used on the label or in labeling of bottled water that contains added fluoride.

<DIV8 N="101.14" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="2">
<HEAD>§ 101.14   Health claims: general requirements.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Definitions.</I> For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Health claim</I> means any claim made on the label or in labeling of a food, including a dietary supplement, that expressly or by implication, including “third party” references, written statements (e.g., a brand name including a term such as “heart”), symbols (e.g., a heart symbol), or vignettes, characterizes the relationship of any substance to a disease or health-related condition. Implied health claims include those statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between the presence or level of a substance in the food and a disease or health-related condition.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Substance</I> means a specific food or component of food, regardless of whether the food is in conventional food form or a dietary supplement that includes vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other similar nutritional substances.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Nutritive value</I> means a value in sustaining human existence by such processes as promoting growth, replacing loss of essential nutrients, or providing energy.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Disqualifying nutrient levels</I> means the levels of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium in a food above which the food will be disqualified from making a health claim. These levels are 13.0 grams (g) of fat, 4.0 g of saturated fat, 60 milligrams (mg) of cholesterol, or 480 mg of sodium, per reference amount customarily consumed, per label serving size, and, only for foods with reference amounts customarily consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less, per 50 g. For dehydrated foods that must have water added to them prior to typical consumption, the per 50-g criterion refers to the as prepared form. Any one of the levels, on a per reference amount customarily consumed, a per label serving size or, when applicable, a per 50 g basis, will disqualify a food from making a health claim unless an exception is provided in subpart E of this part, except that:
</P>
<P>(i) The levels for a meal product as defined in § 101.13(l) are 26.0 g of fat, 8.0 g of saturated fat, 120 mg of cholesterol, or 960 mg of sodium per label serving size, and
</P>
<P>(ii) The levels for a main dish product as defined in § 101.13(m) are 19.5 g of fat, 6.0 g of saturated fat, 90 mg of cholesterol, or 720 mg of sodium per label serving size.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Disease or health-related condition</I> means damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition (claims pertaining to such diseases are thereby not subject to § 101.14 or § 101.70).
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Eligibility.</I> For a substance to be eligible for a health claim:
</P>
<P>(1) The substance must be associated with a disease or health-related condition for which the general U.S. population, or an identified U.S. population subgroup (e.g., the elderly) is at risk, or, alternatively, the petition submitted by the proponent of the claim otherwise explains the prevalence of the disease or health-related condition in the U.S. population and the relevance of the claim in the context of the total daily diet and satisfies the other requirements of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) If the substance is to be consumed as a component of a conventional food at decreased dietary levels, the substance must be a nutrient listed in 21 U.S.C. 343(q)(1)(C) or (q)(1)(D), or one that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required to be included in the label or labeling under 21 U.S.C. 343(q)(2)(A); or
</P>
<P>(3) If the substance is to be consumed at other than decreased dietary levels:
</P>
<P>(i) The substance must, regardless of whether the food is a conventional food or a dietary supplement, contribute taste, aroma, or nutritive value, or any other technical effect listed in § 170.3(o) of this chapter, to the food and must retain that attribute when consumed at levels that are necessary to justify a claim; and
</P>
<P>(ii) The substance must be a food or a food ingredient or a component of a food ingredient whose use at the levels necessary to justify a claim has been demonstrated by the proponent of the claim, to FDA's satisfaction, to be safe and lawful under the applicable food safety provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Validity requirement.</I> FDA will promulgate regulations authorizing a health claim only when it determines, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles), that there is significant scientific agreement, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by such evidence.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>General health claim labeling requirements.</I> (1) When FDA determines that a health claim meets the validity requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, FDA will propose a regulation in subpart E of this part to authorize the use of that claim. If the claim pertains to a substance not provided for in § 101.9 or § 101.36, FDA will propose amending that regulation to include declaration of the substance.
</P>
<P>(2) When FDA has adopted a regulation in subpart E of this part providing for a health claim, firms may make claims based on the regulation in subpart E of this part, provided that:
</P>
<P>(i) All label or labeling statements about the substance-disease relationship that is the subject of the claim are based on, and consistent with, the conclusions set forth in the regulations in subpart E of this part;
</P>
<P>(ii) The claim is limited to describing the value that ingestion (or reduced ingestion) of the substance, as part of a total dietary pattern, may have on a particular disease or health-related condition;
</P>
<P>(iii) The claim is complete, truthful, and not misleading. Where factors other than dietary intake of the substance affect the relationship between the substance and the disease or health-related condition, such factors may be required to be addressed in the claim by a specific regulation in subpart E of this part;
</P>
<P>(iv) All information required to be included in the claim appears in one place without other intervening material, except that the principal display panel of the label or labeling may bear the reference statement, “See ______ for information about the relationship between ______ and ______,” with the blanks filled in with the location of the labeling containing the health claim, the name of the substance, and the disease or health-related condition (e.g., “See attached pamphlet for information about calcium and osteoporosis”), with the entire claim appearing elsewhere on the other labeling, Provided that, where any graphic material (e.g., a heart symbol) constituting an explicit or implied health claim appears on the label or labeling, the reference statement or the complete claim shall appear in immediate proximity to such graphic material;
</P>
<P>(v) The claim enables the public to comprehend the information provided and to understand the relative significance of such information in the context of a total daily diet; and
</P>
<P>(vi) If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance in the food is sufficiently low to justify the claim. To meet this requirement, if a definition for use of the term <I>low</I> has been established for that substance under this part, the substance must be present at a level that meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative level has been established for the substance in subpart E of this part. If no definition for “low” has been established, the level of the substance must meet the level established in the regulation authorizing the claim; or
</P>
<P>(vii) If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at other than decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance is sufficiently high and in an appropriate form to justify the claim. To meet this requirement, if a definition for use of the term <I>high</I> for that substance has been established under this part, the substance must be present at a level that meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative level has been established for the substance in subpart E of this part. If no definition for “high” has been established (e.g., where the claim pertains to a food either as a whole food or as an ingredient in another food), the claim must specify the daily dietary intake necessary to achieve the claimed effect, as established in the regulation authorizing the claim; <I>Provided</I> That:
</P>
<P>(A) Where the food that bears the claim meets the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(vi) or (d)(2)(vii) of this section based on its reference amount customarily consumed, and the labeled serving size differs from that amount, the claim shall be followed by a statement explaining that the claim is based on the reference amount rather than the labeled serving size (e.g., “Diets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure, a disease associated with many factors. A serving of __ ounces of this product conforms to such a diet.”).
</P>
<P>(B) Where the food that bears the claim is sold in a restaurant or in other establishments in which food that is ready for immediate human consumption is sold, the food can meet the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(vi) or (d)(2)(vii) of this section if the firm that sells the food has a reasonable basis on which to believe that the food that bears the claim meets the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(vi) or (d)(2)(vii) of this section and provides that basis upon request.
</P>
<P>(3) Nutrition labeling shall be provided in the label or labeling of any food for which a health claim is made in accordance with § 101.9; for restaurant foods, in accordance with § 101.10; or for dietary supplements, in accordance with § 101.36.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Prohibited health claims.</I> No expressed or implied health claim may be made on the label or in labeling for a food, regardless of whether the food is in conventional food form or dietary supplement form, unless:
</P>
<P>(1) The claim is specifically provided for in subpart E of this part; and
</P>
<P>(2) The claim conforms to all general provisions of this section as well as to all specific provisions in the appropriate section of subpart E of this part;
</P>
<P>(3) None of the disqualifying levels identified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section is exceeded in the food, unless specific alternative levels have been established for the substance in subpart E of this part; or unless FDA has permitted a claim despite the fact that a disqualifying level of a nutrient is present in the food based on a finding that such a claim will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices, and, in accordance with the regulation in subpart E of this part that makes such a finding, the label bears a disclosure statement that complies with § 101.13(h), highlighting the nutrient that exceeds the disqualifying level;
</P>
<P>(4) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, no substance is present at an inappropriate level as determined in the specific provision authorizing the claim in subpart E of this part;
</P>
<P>(5) The label does not represent or purport that the food is for infants and toddlers less than 2 years of age except if the claim is specifically provided for in subpart E of this part; and
</P>
<P>(6) Except for dietary supplements or where provided for in other regulations in part 101, subpart E, the food contains 10 percent or more of the Reference Daily Intake or the Daily Reference Value for vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein, or fiber per reference amount customarily consumed prior to any nutrient addition.
</P>
<P>(f) The requirements of this section do not apply to:
</P>
<P>(1) Infant formulas subject to section 412(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and
</P>
<P>(2) Medical foods defined by section 5(b) of the Orphan Drug Act.
</P>

<HEAD>§ 101.15   Food; prominence of required statements.</HEAD>
<P>(a) A word, statement, or other information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label may lack that prominence and conspicuousness required by section 403(f) of the act by reason (among other reasons) of:
</P>
<P>(1) The failure of such word, statement, or information to appear on the part or panel of the label which is presented or displayed under customary conditions of purchase;
</P>
<P>(2) The failure of such word, statement, or information to appear on two or more parts or panels of the label, each of which has sufficient space therefor, and each of which is so designed as to render it likely to be, under customary conditions of purchase, the part or panel displayed;
</P>
<P>(3) The failure of the label to extend over the area of the container or package available for such extension, so as to provide sufficient label space for the prominent placing of such word, statement, or information;
</P>
<P>(4) Insufficiency of label space (for the prominent placing of such word, statement, or information) resulting from the use of label space for any word, statement, design, or device which is not required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label;
</P>
<P>(5) Insufficiency of label space (for the prominent placing of such word, statement, or information) resulting from the use of label space to give materially greater conspicuousness to any other word, statement, or information, or to any design or device; or
</P>
<P>(6) Smallness or style of type in which such word, statement, or information appears, insufficient background contrast, obscuring designs or vignettes, or crowding with other written, printed, or graphic matter.
</P>
<P>(b) No exemption depending on insufficiency of label space, as prescribed in regulations promulgated under section 403 (e) or (i) of the act, shall apply if such insufficiency is caused by:
</P>
<P>(1) The use of label space for any word, statement, design, or device which is not required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label;
</P>
<P>(2) The use of label space to give greater conspicuousness to any word, statement, or other information than is required by section 403(f) of the act; or
</P>
<P>(3) The use of label space for any representation in a foreign language.
</P>
<P>(c)(1) All words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label or labeling shall appear thereon in the English language: <I>Provided, however,</I> That in the case of articles distributed solely in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or in a Territory where the predominant language is one other than English, the predominant language may be substituted for English.
</P>
<P>(2) If the label contains any representation in a foreign language, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label shall appear thereon in the foreign language: <I>Provided, however,</I> That individual serving-size packages of foods containing no more than 1

</P>
<P>(5) The safe handling statement for shell eggs that are not for direct sale to consumers, e.g., those that are to be repacked or labeled at a site other than where originally processed, or are sold for use in food service establishments, may be provided on cartons or in labeling, e.g., invoices or bills of lading in accordance with the practice of the trade. 
</P>
<P>(6) Under sections 311 and 361 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), any State or locality that is willing and able to assist the agency in the enforcement of paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(5) of this section, and is authorized to inspect or regulate establishments handling packed shell eggs, may in its own jurisdiction, enforce paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(5) of this section through inspections under paragraph (h)(8) of this section and through administrative enforcement remedies identified in paragraph (h)(7) of this section until FDA notifies the State or locality in writing that such assistance is no longer needed. When providing such assistance, a State or locality may follow the hearing procedures set out in paragraphs (h)(7)(ii)(C) through (h)(7)(ii)(D) of this section, substituting, where necessary, appropriate State or local officials for designated FDA officials or may utilize State or local hearing procedures if such procedures satisfy due process. 
</P>
<P>(7) This paragraph (h) is established under authority of both the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) and the PHS Act. Under the act, the agency can enforce the food misbranding provisions under 21 U.S.C. 331, 332, 333, and 334. However, 42 U.S.C. 264 provides for the issuance of implementing enforcement regulations; therefore, FDA has established the following administrative enforcement procedures for the relabeling, diversion, or destruction of shell eggs and informal hearings under the PHS Act: 
</P>
<P>(i) Upon finding that any shell eggs are in violation of this section an authorized FDA representative or State or local representative in accordance with paragraph (h)(6) of this section may order such eggs to be relabeled under the supervision of said representative, diverted, under the supervision of said representative for processing in accordance with the Egg Products Inspection Act (EPIA) (21 U.S.C. 1031 <I>et seq.</I>), or destroyed by or under the supervision of an officer or employee of the FDA, or, if applicable, of the State or locality, in accordance with the following procedures: 
</P>
<P>(A) <I>Order for relabeling, diversion, or destruction under the PHS Act.</I> Any division office of FDA or any State or locality acting under paragraph (h)(6) of this section, upon finding shell eggs held in violation of this section, may serve upon the person in whose possession such eggs are found a written order that such eggs be relabeled with the required statement in paragraph (h)(1) of this section before further distribution. If the person chooses not to relabel, the division office of FDA or, if applicable, the appropriate State or local agency may serve upon the person a written order that such eggs be diverted (from direct consumer sale, <I>e.g.,</I> to food service) under the supervision of an officer or employee of the issuing entity, for processing in accordance with the EPIA (21 U.S.C. 1031 <I>et seq.</I>) or destroyed by or under the supervision of the issuing entity, within 10 working days from the date of receipt of the order. 
</P>
<P>(B) <I>Issuance of order.</I> The order shall include the following information: 
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) A statement that the shell eggs identified in the order are subject to relabeling, diversion for processing in accordance with the EPIA, or destruction;

</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) The location of the eggs; 
</P>
<P>(<I>4</I>) A statement that these eggs shall not be sold, distributed, or otherwise disposed of or moved except as provided in paragraph (h)(7)(i)(E) of this section; 
</P>
<P>(<I>5</I>) Identification or description of the eggs; 
</P>
<P>(<I>6</I>) The order number; 
</P>
<P>(<I>7</I>) The date of the order; 
</P>
<P>(<I>8</I>) The text of this entire section; 
</P>
<P>(<I>9</I>) A statement that the order may be appealed by written appeal or by requesting an informal hearing;

<P>(<I>10</I>) The name and phone number of the person issuing the order; and 
</P>
<P>(<I>11</I>) The location and telephone number of the responsible office or agency and the name of its director. 
</P>
<P>(C) <I>Approval of director.</I> An order, before issuance, shall be approved by the director of the office or agency issuing the order. If prior written approval is not feasible, prior oral approval shall be obtained and confirmed by written memorandum as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>(D) <I>Labeling or marking of shell eggs under order.</I> An FDA, State, or local representative issuing an order under paragraph (h)(7)(i)(A) of this section shall label or mark the shell eggs with official tags that include the following information: 
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) A statement that the shell eggs are detained in accordance with regulations issued under section 361(a) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 264(a)). 
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) A statement that the shell eggs shall not be sold, distributed or otherwise disposed of or moved except, after notifying the issuing entity in writing, to: 
</P>
<P>(<I>i</I>) Relabel, divert them for processing in accordance with the EPIA, or destroy them, or 
</P>
<P>(<I>ii</I>) Move them to another location for holding pending appeal. 
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) A statement that the violation of the order or the removal or alteration of the tag is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both (section 368 of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 271). 
</P>
<P>(<I>4</I>) The order number and the date of the order, and the name of the government representative who issued the order. 
</P>
<P>(E) <I>Sale or other disposition of shell eggs under order.</I> After service of the order, the person in possession of the shell eggs that are the subject of the order shall not sell, distribute, or otherwise dispose of or move any eggs subject to the order unless and until the notice is withdrawn after an appeal except, after notifying FDA's division office or, if applicable, the State or local agency in writing, to: 
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) Relabel, divert, or destroy them as specified in paragraph (h)(7)(i) of this section, or 
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) Move them to another location for holding pending appeal. 
</P>
<P>(ii) The person on whom the order for relabeling, diversion, or destruction is served may either comply with the order or appeal the order to an Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Director.
</P>
<P>(A) <I>Appeal of a detention order.</I> Any appeal shall be submitted in writing to the FDA Division Director in whose division the shell eggs are located within 5 working days of the issuance of the order. If the appeal includes a request for an informal hearing, the hearing shall be held within 5 working days after the appeal is filed or, if requested by the appellant, at a later date, which shall not be later than 20 calendar days after the issuance of the order. The order may also be appealed within the same period of 5 working days by any other person having an ownership or proprietary interest in such shell eggs. The appellant of an order shall state the ownership or proprietary interest the appellant has in the shell eggs.
</P>
<P>(B) <I>Summary decision.</I> A request for a hearing may be denied, in whole or in part and at any time after a request for a hearing has been submitted, if the Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Director or another FDA official senior to an FDA Division Director determines that no genuine and substantial issue of fact has been raised by the material submitted in connection with the hearing or from matters officially noticed. If the presiding FDA official determines that a hearing is not justified, written notice of the determination will be given to the parties explaining the reason for denial.
</P>
<P>(C) <I>Informal hearing.</I> Appearance by any appellant at the hearing may be by mail or in person, with or without counsel. The informal hearing shall be conducted by an Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Director or another FDA official senior to an FDA Division Director, and a written summary of the proceedings shall be prepared by the presiding FDA official.
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) The presiding FDA official may direct that the hearing be conducted in any suitable manner permitted by law and this section. The presiding FDA official has the power to take such actions and make such rulings as are necessary or appropriate to maintain order and to conduct an informal, fair, expeditious, and impartial hearing, and to enforce the requirements concerning the conduct of hearings.
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) Employees of FDA will first give a full and complete statement of the action which is the subject of the hearing, together with the information and reasons supporting it, and may present oral or written information relevant to the hearing. The party requesting the hearing may then present oral or written information relevant to the hearing. All parties may conduct reasonable examination of any person (except for the presiding officer and counsel for the parties) who makes any statement on the matter at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) The hearing shall be informal in nature, and the rules of evidence do not apply. No motions or objections relating to the admissibility of information and views will be made or considered, but any party may comment upon or rebut any information and views presented by another party. 
</P>
<P>(<I>4</I>) The party requesting the hearing may have the hearing transcribed, at the party's expense, in which case a copy of the transcript is to be furnished to FDA. Any transcript of the hearing will be included with the presiding FDA official's report of the hearing.
</P>
<P>(<I>5</I>) The presiding FDA official shall prepare a written report of the hearing. All written material presented at the hearing will be attached to the report. Whenever time permits, the presiding FDA official may give the parties the opportunity to review and comment on the report of the hearing.
</P>
<P>(<I>6</I>) The presiding FDA official shall include as part of the report of the hearing a finding on the credibility of witnesses (other than expert witnesses) whenever credibility is a material issue, and shall include a recommended decision, with a statement of reasons.
</P>
<P>(D) <I>Written appeal.</I> If the appellant appeals the detention order but does not request a hearing, the presiding FDA official shall render a decision on the appeal affirming or revoking the detention within 5-working days after the receipt of the appeal.
</P>
<P>(E) <I>Presiding FDA official's decision.</I> If, based on the evidence presented at the hearing or by the appellant in a written appeal, the presiding FDA official finds that the shell eggs were held in violation of this section, he shall affirm the order that they be relabeled, diverted under the supervision of an officer or employee of FDA for processing under the EPIA, or destroyed by or under the supervision of an officer or employee of FDA; otherwise, the presiding FDA official shall issue a written notice that the prior order is withdrawn. If the presiding FDA official affirms the order, he shall order that the relabeling, diversion, or destruction be accomplished within 10-working days from the date of the issuance of his decision. The presiding FDA official's decision shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the decision. The decision of the presiding FDA official shall constitute final agency action, reviewable in the courts.
</P>
<P>(F) <I>No appeal.</I> If there is no appeal of the order and the person in possession of the shell eggs that are subject to the order fails to relabel, divert, or destroy them within 10 working days, or if the demand is affirmed by the presiding FDA official after an appeal and the person in possession of such eggs fails to relabel, divert, or destroy them within 10 working days, the FDA division office, or, if applicable, the State or local agency may designate an officer or employee to divert or destroy such eggs. It shall be unlawful to prevent or to attempt to prevent such diversion or destruction of the shell eggs by the designated officer or employee.
</P>
<P>(8) Persons engaged in handling or storing packed shell eggs for retail distribution shall permit authorized representatives of FDA to make at any reasonable time such inspection of the establishment in which shell eggs are being held, including inspection and sampling of the labeling of such eggs as may be necessary in the judgment of such representatives to determine compliance with the provisions of this section. Inspections may be made with or without notice and will ordinarily be made during regular business hours. 
</P>
<P>(9) No State or local governing entity shall establish or continue in effect any law, rule, regulation, or other requirement requiring safe handling instructions on unpasteurized shell eggs that are less stringent than those required in paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(5) of this section.

</P>
<P>(b) The labeling of a food which contains two or more ingredients may be misleading by reason (among other reasons) of the designation of such food in such labeling by a name which includes or suggests the name of one or more but not all such ingredients, even though the names of all such ingredients are stated elsewhere in the labeling.

<P>(a)(1) The term <I>artificial flavor</I> or <I>artificial flavoring</I> means any substance, the function of which is to impart flavor, which is not derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof. Artificial flavor includes the substances listed in §§ 172.515(b) and 182.60 of this chapter except where these are derived from natural sources. 
</P>
<P>(2) The term <I>spice</I> means any aromatic vegetable substance in the whole, broken, or ground form, except for those substances which have been traditionally regarded as foods, such as onions, garlic and celery; whose significant function in food is seasoning rather than nutritional; that is true to name; and from which no portion of any volatile oil or other flavoring principle has been removed. Spices include the spices listed in § 182.10 and part 184 of this chapter, such as the following:
</P>
<EXTRACT>
<FP-1>Allspice, Anise, Basil, Bay leaves, Caraway seed, Cardamon, Celery seed, Chervil, Cinnamon, Cloves, Coriander, Cumin seed, Dill seed, Fennel seed, Fenugreek, Ginger, Horseradish, Mace, Marjoram, Mustard flour, Nutmeg, Oregano, Paprika, Parsley, Pepper, black; Pepper, white; Pepper, red; Rosemary, Saffron, Sage, Savory, Star aniseed, Tarragon, Thyme, Turmeric.</FP-1></EXTRACT>
<FP>Paprika, turmeric, and saffron or other spices which are also colors, shall be declared as “spice and coloring” unless declared by their common or usual name.
</FP>
<P>(3) The term <I>natural flavor</I> or <I>natural flavoring</I> means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in §§ 182.10, 182.20, 182.40, and 182.50 and part 184 of this chapter, and the substances listed in § 172.510 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(4) The term <I>artificial color</I> or <I>artificial coloring</I> means any “color additive” as defined in § 70.3(f) of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(5) The term <I>chemical preservative</I> means any chemical that, when added to food, tends to prevent or retard deterioration thereof, but does not include common salt, sugars, vinegars, spices, or oils extracted from spices, substances added to food by direct exposure thereof to wood smoke, or chemicals applied for their insecticidal or herbicidal properties.
</P>
<P>(b) A food which is subject to the requirements of section 403(k) of the act shall bear labeling, even though such food is not in package form.
</P>
<P>(c) A statement of artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservative shall be placed on the food or on its container or wrapper, or on any two or all three of these, as may be necessary to render such statement likely to be read by the ordinary person under customary conditions of purchase and use of such food. The specific artificial color used in a food shall be identified on the labeling when so required by regulation in part 74 of this chapter to assure safe conditions of use for the color additive.
</P>
<P>(d) A food shall be exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 403(k) of the act if it is not in package form and the units thereof are so small that a statement of artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservative, as the case may be, cannot be placed on such units with such conspicuousness as to render it likely to be read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.
</P>
<P>(e) A food shall be exempt while held for sale from the requirements of section 403(k) of the act (requiring label statement of any artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservatives) if said food, having been received in bulk containers at a retail establishment, is displayed to the purchaser with either (1) the labeling of the bulk container plainly in view or (2) a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the information required to be stated on the label pursuant to section 403(k).
</P>
<P>(f) A fruit or vegetable shall be exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 403(k) of the act with respect to a chemical preservative applied to the fruit or vegetable as a pesticide chemical prior to harvest.
</P>
<P>(g) A flavor shall be labeled in the following way when shipped to a food manufacturer or processor (but not a consumer) for use in the manufacture of a fabricated food, unless it is a flavor for which a standard of identity has been promulgated, in which case it shall be labeled as provided in the standard:
</P>
<P>(1) If the flavor consists of one ingredient, it shall be declared by its common or usual name.
</P>
<P>(2) If the flavor consists of two or more ingredients, the label either may declare each ingredient by its common or usual name or may state “All flavor ingredients contained in this product are approved for use in a regulation of the Food and Drug Administration.” Any flavor ingredient not contained in one of these regulations, and any nonflavor ingredient, shall be separately listed on the label.
</P>
<P>(3) In cases where the flavor contains a solely natural flavor(s), the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g., “strawberry flavor”, “banana flavor”, or “natural strawberry flavor”. In cases where the flavor contains both a natural flavor and an artificial flavor, the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g., “natural and artificial strawberry flavor”. In cases where the flavor contains a solely artificial flavor(s), the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g., “artificial strawberry flavor”.
</P>
<P>(h) The label of a food to which flavor is added shall declare the flavor in the statement of ingredients in the following way:
</P>
<P>(1) Spice, natural flavor, and artificial flavor may be declared as “spice”, “natural flavor”, or “artificial flavor”, or any combination thereof, as the case may be.
</P>
<P>(2) An incidental additive in a food, originating in a spice or flavor used in the manufacture of the food, need not be declared in the statement of ingredients if it meets the requirements of § 101.100(a)(3).
</P>
<P>(3) Substances obtained by cutting, grinding, drying, pulping, or similar processing of tissues derived from fruit, vegetable, meat, fish, or poultry, e.g., powdered or granulated onions, garlic powder, and celery powder, are commonly understood by consumers to be food rather than flavor and shall be declared by their common or usual name.
</P>
<P>(4) Any salt (sodium chloride) used as an ingredient in food shall be declared by its common or usual name “salt.”
</P>
<P>(5) Any monosodium glutamate used as an ingredient in food shall be declared by its common or usual name “monosodium glutamate.”
</P>
<P>(6) Any pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavors used as an ingredient in a food may be declared as artificial flavor or artificial smoke flavor. No representation may be made, either directly or implied, that a food flavored with pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavor has been smoked or has a true smoked flavor, or that a seasoning sauce or similar product containing pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavor and used to season or flavor other foods will result in a smoked product or one having a true smoked flavor.
</P>
<P>(7) Because protein hydrolysates function in foods as both flavorings and flavor enhancers, no protein hydrolysate used in food for its effects on flavor may be declared simply as “flavor,” “natural flavor,” or “flavoring.” The ingredient shall be declared by its specific common or usual name as provided in § 102.22 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(i) If the label, labeling, or advertising of a food makes any direct or indirect representations with respect to the primary recognizable flavor(s), by word, vignette, e.g., depiction of a fruit, or other means, or if for any other reason the manufacturer or distributor of a food wishes to designate the type of flavor in the food other than through the statement of ingredients, such flavor shall be considered the characterizing flavor and shall be declared in the following way:
</P>
<P>(1) If the food contains no artificial flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the name of the food on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be accompanied by the common or usual name of the characterizing flavor, e.g., “vanilla”, in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the food, except that:
</P>
<P>(i) If the food is one that is commonly expected to contain a characterizing food ingredient, e.g., strawberries in “strawberry shortcake”, and the food contains natural flavor derived from such ingredient and an amount of characterizing ingredient insufficient to independently characterize the food, or the food contains no such ingredient, the name of the characterizing flavor may be immediately preceded by the word “natural” and shall be immediately followed by the word “flavored” in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of the characterizing flavor, e.g., “natural strawberry flavored shortcake,” or “strawberry flavored shortcake”.
</P>
<P>(ii) If none of the natural flavor used in the food is derived from the product whose flavor is simulated, the food in which the flavor is used shall be labeled either with the flavor of the product from which the flavor is derived or as “artificially flavored.”
</P>
<P>(iii) If the food contains both a characterizing flavor from the product whose flavor is simulated and other natural flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the food shall be labeled in accordance with the introductory text and paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section and the name of the food shall be immediately followed by the words “with other natural flavor” in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the characterizing flavor.
</P>
<P>(2) If the food contains any artificial flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the name of the food on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be accompanied by the common or usual name(s) of the characterizing flavor, in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the food and the name of the characterizing flavor shall be accompanied by the word(s) “artificial” or “artificially flavored”, in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of the characterizing flavor, e.g., “artificial vanilla”, “artificially flavored strawberry”, or “grape artificially flavored”.
</P>
<P>(3) Wherever the name of the characterizing flavor appears on the label (other than in the statement of ingredients) so conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions of purchase, the words prescribed by this paragraph shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow such name, without any intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, except:
</P>
<P>(i) Where the characterizing flavor and a trademark or brand are presented together, other written, printed, or graphic matter that is a part of or is associated with the trademark or brand may intervene if the required words are in such relationship with the trademark or brand as to be clearly related to the characterizing flavor; and
</P>
<P>(ii) If the finished product contains more than one flavor subject to the requirements of this paragraph, the statements required by this paragraph need appear only once in each statement of characterizing flavors present in such food, e.g., “artificially flavored vanilla and strawberry”.
</P>
<P>(iii) If the finished product contains three or more distinguishable characterizing flavors, or a blend of flavors with no primary recognizable flavor, the flavor may be declared by an appropriately descriptive generic term in lieu of naming each flavor, e.g., “artificially flavored fruit punch”.
</P>
<P>(4) A flavor supplier shall certify, in writing, that any flavor he supplies which is designated as containing no artificial flavor does not, to the best of his knowledge and belief, contain any artificial flavor, and that he has added no artificial flavor to it. The requirement for such certification may be satisfied by a guarantee under section 303(c)(2) of the act which contains such a specific statement. A flavor user shall be required to make such a written certification only where he adds to or combines another flavor with a flavor which has been certified by a flavor supplier as containing no artificial flavor, but otherwise such user may rely upon the supplier's certification and need make no separate certification. All such certifications shall be retained by the certifying party throughout the period in which the flavor is supplied and for a minimum of three years thereafter, and shall be subject to the following conditions:
</P>
<P>(i) The certifying party shall make such certifications available upon request at all reasonable hours to any duly authorized office or employee of the Food and Drug Administration or any other employee acting on behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Such certifications are regarded by the Food and Drug Administration as reports to the government and as guarantees or other undertakings within the meaning of section 301(h) of the act and subject the certifying party to the penalties for making any false report to the government under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and any false guarantee or undertaking under section 303(a) of the act. The defenses provided under section 303(c)(2) of the act shall be applicable to the certifications provided for in this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) Wherever possible, the Food and Drug Administration shall verify the accuracy of a reasonable number of certifications made pursuant to this section, constituting a representative sample of such certifications, and shall not request all such certifications.
</P>
<P>(iii) Where no person authorized to provide such information is reasonably available at the time of inspection, the certifying party shall arrange to have such person and the relevant materials and records ready for verification as soon as practicable: <I>Provided,</I> That, whenever the Food and Drug Administration has reason to believe that the supplier or user may utilize this period to alter inventories or records, such additional time shall not be permitted. Where such additional time is provided, the Food and Drug Administration may require the certifying party to certify that relevant inventories have not been materially disturbed and relevant records have not been altered or concealed during such period.
</P>
<P>(iv) The certifying party shall provide, to an officer or representative duly designated by the Secretary, such qualitative statement of the composition of the flavor or product covered by the certification as may be reasonably expected to enable the Secretary's representatives to determine which relevant raw and finished materials and flavor ingredient records are reasonably necessary to verify the certifications. The examination conducted by the Secretary's representative shall be limited to inspection and review of inventories and ingredient records for those certifications which are to be verified.
</P>
<P>(v) Review of flavor ingredient records shall be limited to the qualitative formula and shall not include the quantitative formula. The person verifying the certifications may make only such notes as are necessary to enable him to verify such certification. Only such notes or such flavor ingredient records as are necessary to verify such certification or to show a potential or actual violation may be removed or transmitted from the certifying party's place of business: <I>Provided,</I> That, where such removal or transmittal is necessary for such purposes the relevant records and notes shall be retained as separate documents in Food and Drug Administration files, shall not be copied in other reports, and shall not be disclosed publicly other than in a judicial proceeding brought pursuant to the act or 18 U.S.C. 1001.
</P>
<P>(j) A food to which a chemical preservative(s) is added shall, except when exempt pursuant to § 101.100 bear a label declaration stating both the common or usual name of the ingredient(s) and a separate description of its function, e.g., “preservative”, “to retard spoilage”, “a mold inhibitor”, “to help protect flavor” or “to promote color retention”.
</P>
<P>(k) The label of a food to which any coloring has been added shall declare the coloring in the statement of ingredients in the manner specified in paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section, except that colorings added to butter, cheese, and ice cream, if declared, may be declared in the manner specified in paragraph (k)(3) of this section, and colorings added to foods subject to §§ 105.62 and 105.65 of this chapter shall be declared in accordance with the requirements of those sections.
</P>
<P>(1) A color additive or the lake of a color additive subject to certification under 721(c) of the act shall be declared by the name of the color additive listed in the applicable regulation in part 74 or part 82 of this chapter, except that it is not necessary to include the “FD&amp;C” prefix or the term “No.” in the declaration, but the term “Lake” shall be included in the declaration of the lake of the certified color additive (e.g., Blue 1 Lake). Manufacturers may parenthetically declare an appropriate alternative name of the certified color additive following its common or usual name as specified in part 74 or part 82 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(2) Color additives not subject to certification and not otherwise required by applicable regulations in part 73 of this chapter to be declared by their respective common or usual names may be declared as “Artificial Color,” “Artificial Color Added,” or “Color Added” (or by an equally informative term that makes clear that a color additive has been used in the food). Alternatively, such color additives may be declared as “Colored with ________________” or “________________ color,” the blank to be filled in with the name of the color additive listed in the applicable regulation in part 73 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(3) When a coloring has been added to butter, cheese, or ice cream, it need not be declared in the ingredient list unless such declaration is required by a regulation in part 73 or part 74 of this chapter to ensure safe conditions of use for the color additive. Voluntary declaration of all colorings added to butter, cheese, and ice cream, however, is recommended.

<DIV8 N="101.30" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="2">
<HEAD>§ 101.30   Percentage juice declaration for foods purporting to be beverages that contain fruit or vegetable juice.</HEAD>
<P>(a) This section applies to any food that purports to be a beverage that contains any fruit or vegetable juice (i.e., the product's advertising, label, or labeling bears the name of, or variation on the name of, or makes any other direct or indirect representation with respect to, any fruit or vegetable juice), or the label or labeling bears any vignette (i.e., depiction of a fruit or vegetable) or other pictorial representation of any fruit or vegetable, or the product contains color and flavor that gives the beverage the appearance and taste of containing a fruit or vegetable juice. The beverage may be carbonated or noncarbonated, concentrated, full-strength, diluted, or contain no juice. For example, a soft drink (soda) that does not represent or suggest by its physical characteristics, name, labeling, ingredient statement, or advertising that it contains fruit or vegetable juice does not purport to contain juice and therefore does not require a percent juice declaration.
</P>
<P>(b)(1) If the beverage contains fruit or vegetable juice, the percentage shall be declared by the words “Contains __ percent (or %) ______ juice” or “__ percent (or %) juice,” or a similar phrase, with the first blank filled in with the percentage expressed as a whole number not greater than the actual percentage of the juice and the second blank (if used) filled in with the name of the particular fruit or vegetable (e.g., “Contains 50 percent apple juice” or “50 percent juice”).
</P>
<P>(2) If the beverage contains less than 1 percent juice, the total percentage juice shall be declared as “less than 1 percent juice” or “less than 1 percent ______ juice” with the blank filled in with the name of the particular fruit or vegetable.
</P>
<P>(3) If the beverage contains 100 percent juice and also contains non-juice ingredients that do not result in a diminution of the juice soluble solids or, in the case of expressed juice, in a change in the volume, when the 100 percent juice declaration appears on a panel of the label that does not also bear the ingredient statement, it must be accompanied by the phrase “with added ______,” the blank filled in with a term such as “ingredient(s),” “preservative,” or “sweetener,” as appropriate (e.g., “100% juice with added sweetener”), except that when the presence of the non-juice ingredient(s) is declared as a part of the statement of identity of the product, this phrase need not accompany the 100 percent juice declaration.
</P>
<P>(c) If a beverage contains minor amounts of juice for flavoring and is labeled with a flavor description using terms such as “flavor”, “flavored”, or “flavoring” with a fruit or vegetable name and does not bear:
</P>
<P>(1) The term “juice” on the label other than in the ingredient statement; or
</P>
<P>(2) An explicit vignette depicting the fruit or vegetable from which the flavor derives, such as juice exuding from a fruit or vegetable; or
</P>
<P>(3) Specific physical resemblance to a juice or distinctive juice characteristic such as pulp then total percentage juice declaration is not required.
</P>
<P>(d) If the beverage does not meet the criteria for exemption from total juice percentage declaration as described in paragraph (c) of this section and contains no fruit or vegetable juice, but the labeling or color and flavor of the beverage represents, suggests, or implies that fruit or vegetable juice may be present (e.g., the product advertising or labeling bears the name, a variation of the name, or a pictorial representation of any fruit or vegetable, or the product contains color and flavor that give the beverage the appearance and taste of containing a fruit or vegetable juice), then the label shall declare “contains zero (0) percent (or %) juice”. Alternatively, the label may declare “Containing (or contains) no ______ juice”, or “no ______ juice”, or “does not contain ______ juice”, the blank to be filled in with the name of the fruits or vegetables represented, suggested, or implied, but if there is a general suggestion that the product contains fruit or vegetable juice, such as the presence of fruit pulp, the blank shall be filled in with the word “fruit” or “vegetable” as applicable (e.g., “contains no fruit juice”, or “does not contain fruit juice”).
</P>
<P>(e) If the beverage is sold in a package with an information panel as defined in § 101.2, the declaration of amount of juice shall be prominently placed on the information panel in lines generally parallel to other required information, appearing:
</P>
<P>(1) Near the top of the information panel, with no other printed label information appearing above the statement except the brand name, product name, logo, or universal product code; and
</P>
<P>(2) In easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, in a height not less than the largest type found on the information panel except that used for the brand name, product name, logo, universal product code, the title phrase “Nutrition Facts,” the declaration of “Serving size,” “Calories” and the numerical value for “Calories appearing in the nutrition information as required by § 101.9.
</P>
<P>(f) The percentage juice declaration may also be placed on the principal display panel, provided that the declaration is consistent with that presented on the information panel.
</P>
<P>(g) If the beverage is sold in a package that does not bear an information panel as defined in § 101.2, the percentage juice declaration shall be placed on the principal display panel, in type size not less than that required for the declaration of net quantity of contents statement in § 101.7(i), and be placed near the name of the food.
</P>
<P>(h)(1) In enforcing these regulations, the Food and Drug Administration will calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix levels listed below where single-strength (100 percent) juice has at least the specified minimum Brix listed below:

<HD1>General Instructions
</HD1>
<P>All glassware should be scrupulously cleaned to remove all organic matter such as oil, grease, detergent residues, etc. Examine all glassware, including stoppers and stopcocks, under ultraviolet light to detect any residual fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure, it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care to avoid contamination of hydrocarbon solvent samples in handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate packaging is essential. Because some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this test are very susceptible to photo-oxidation, the entire procedure is to be carried out under subdued light.

</P>
<HD1>Procedure
</HD1>
<P><I>Determination of ultraviolet absorbance.</I> Before proceeding with the analysis of a sample determine the absorbance in a 1-centimeter path cell for the reagent blank by carrying out the procedure without a sample. Record the absorbance in the wavelength range of 280 to 400 millimicrons. Typical reagent blank absorbance in this range should not exceed 0.04 in the 280 to 299 millimicron range, 0.02 in the 300 to 359 millimicron range, and 0.01 in the 360 to 400 millimicron range. If the characteristic benzene peaks in the 250 to 260 millimicron region are present, remove the benzene by the procedure described above under “Reagents and Materials,” “Organic Solvents,” and record absorbance again.
</P>
<P>Transfer 50 grams of silica gel to the chromatographic tube for sample analysis. Raise and drop the column on a semisoft, clean surface for about 1 minute to settle the gel. Pour 100 milliliters of hexane into the column with the stopcock open and allow to drain to about one-half inch above the gel. Turn off the stopcock and allow the column to cool for 30 minutes. After cooling, vibrate the column to eliminate air and stir the top 1 to 2 inches with a small diameter stainless steel rod. Take care not to get the gel above the liquid and onto the sides of the column.
</P>
<P>Weigh out 40 grams ±0.1 gram of the hydrocarbon solvent sample into a 250-milliliter beaker, add 50 milliliters of hexane, and pour the solution into the column. Rinse the beaker with 50 milliliters of hexane and add this to the column. Allow the hexane sample solution to elute into a 500-milliliter beaker until the solution is about one-half inch above the gel. Rinse the column three times with 50-milliliter portions of hexane. Allow each hexane rinse to separately elute to about one-half inch above the gel. Replace the eluate beaker (discard the hexane eluate) with a 250-milliliter beaker. Add two separate 25-milliliter portions of 10 percent 1,2-dichloroethane and allow each to separately elute as before. Finally, add 150 milliliters of 10 percent 1,2-dichloroethane for a total of 200 milliliters. When the final 10 percent 1,2-dichloroethane fraction is about one-half inch above the top of the gel bed, replace the receiving beaker (discard the 1,2-dichloroethane eluate) with a 250-milliliter beaker containing 1 milliliter of hexadecane. Adjust the elution rate to 2 to 3 milliliters per minute, add two 25-milliliter portions of 40 percent benzene and allow each to separately elute as before to within about one-half inch of the gel bed. Finally, add 150 milliliters of 40 percent benzene for a total of 200 milliliters. Evaporate the benzene in the oven with vacuum and sufficient nitrogen flow to just ripple the top of the benzene solution. When the benzene is removed (as determined by a constant volume of hexadecane) add 5 milliliters of isooctane and evaporate. Repeat once to insure complete removal of benzene. Remove the beaker and cover with aluminum foil (previously rinsed with hexane) until cool.
</P>
<P>Quantitatively transfer the hexadecane residue to a 5-milliliter volumetric flask and dilute to volume with isooctane. Determine the absorbance of the solution in 1-centimeter path length cells between 280 and 400 millimicrons using isooctane as a reference. Correct the absorbance values for any absorbance derived from reagents as determined by carrying out the procedure without a sample. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits prescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the sample meets the ultraviolet absorbance specifications for hydrocarbon solvent.</P></EXTRACT>

<HD1>general instructions
</HD1>
<P>Because of the sensitivity of the test, the possibility of errors arising from contamination is great. It is of the greatest importance that all glassware be scrupulously cleaned to remove all organic matter such as oil, grease, detergent residues, etc. Examine all glassware, including stoppers and stopcocks, under ultraviolet light to detect any residual fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care to avoid contamination of wax samples in handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate packaging is essential. Because some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this test are very susceptible to photo-oxidation, the entire procedure is to be carried out under subdued light.

<HD1>reagents and materials
</HD1>
<P><I>Organic solvents.</I> All solvents used throughout the procedure shall meet the specifications and tests described in this specification. The isooctane, benzene, acetone, and methyl alcohol designated in the list following this paragraph shall pass the following test:
</P>
<P>To the specified quantity of solvent in a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask, add 1 milliliter of purified <I>n-</I>hexadecane and evaporate on the steam bath under a stream of nitrogen (a) loose aluminum foil jacket around the flask will speed evaporation). Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 milliliter of residue remains. (To the residue from benzene add a 10-milliliter portion of purified isooctane, reevaporate, and repeat once to insure complete removal of benzene.)
</P>
<P>Alternatively, the evaporation time can be reduced by using the optional evaporation flask. In this case the solvent and <I>n-</I>hexadecane are placed in the flask on the steam bath, the tube assembly is inserted, and a stream of nitrogen is fed through the inlet tube while the outlet tube is connected to a solvent trap and vacuum line in such a way as to prevent any flow-back of condensate into the flask.
</P>
<P>Dissolve the 1 milliliter of hexadecane residue in isooctane and make to 25 milliliters volume. Determine the absorbance in the 5-centimeter path length cells compared to isooctane as reference. The absorbance of the solution of the solvent residue (except for methyl alcohol) shall not exceed 0.01 per centimeter path length between 280 and 400 mµ. For methyl alcohol this absorbance value shall be 0.00. 
</P>
<P><I>Isooctane</I> (<I>2,2,4-trimethylpentane</I>). Use 180 milliliters for the test described in the preceding paragraph. Purify, if necessary, by passage through a column of activated silica gel (Grade 12, Davison Chemical Company, Baltimore, Maryland, or equivalent) about 90 centimeters in length and 5 centimeters to 8 centimeters in diameter.
</P>
<P><I>Benzene, A.C.S. reagent grade.</I> Use 150 milliliters for the test. Purify, if necessary, by distillation or otherwise.
</P>
<P><I>Acetone, A.C.S. reagent grade.</I> Use 200 milliliters for the test. Purify, if necessary, by distillation.
</P>
<P>Eluting mixtures:
</P>
<P>1. <I>10 percent benzene in isooctane.</I> Pipet 50 milliliters of benzene into a 500-milliliter glass-stoppered volumetric flask and adjust to volume with isooctane, with mixing.
</P>
<P>2. <I>20 percent benzene in isooctane.</I> Pipet 50 milliliters of benzene into a 250-milliliter glass-stoppered volumetric flask, and adjust to volume with isooctane, with mixing.
</P>
<P>3. <I>Acetone-benzene-water mixture.</I> Add 20 milliliters of water to 380 milliliters of acetone and 200 milliliters of benzene, and mix.
</P>
<P><I>n-Hexadecane, 99 percent olefin-free.</I> Dilute 1.0 milliliter of <I>n-</I>hexadecane to 25 milliliters with isooctane and determine the absorbance in a 5-centimeter cell compared to isooctane as reference point between 280 mµ-400 mµ. The absorbance per centimeter path length shall not exceed 0.00 in this range. Purify, if necessary, by percolation through activated silica gel or by distillation.
</P>
<P><I>Methyl alcohol, A.C.S. reagent grade.</I> Use 10.0 milliliters of methyl alcohol. Purify, if necessary, by distillation.
</P>
<P><I>Dimethyl sulfoxide.</I> Pure grade, clear, water-white, m.p. 18° minimum. Dilute 120 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide with 240 milliliters of distilled water in a 500-milliliter separatory funnel, mix and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes. Add 40 milliliters of isooctane to the solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes. Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second 500-milliliter separatory funnel and repeat the extraction with 40 milliliters of isooctane. Draw off and discard the aqueous layer. Wash each of the 40-milliliter extractives three times with 50-milliliter portions of distilled water. Shaking time for each wash is 1 minute. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extractive through anhydrous sodium sulfate prewashed with isooctane (see <I>Sodium sulfate under</I> “Reagents and Materials” for preparation of filter), into a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask, or optionally into the evaporating flask. Wash the first separatory funnel with the second 40-milliliter isooctane extractive, and pass through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Then wash the second and first separatory funnels successively with a 10-milliliter portion of isooctane, and pass the solvent through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Add 1 milliliter of <I>n-</I>hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under nitrogen. Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 milliliter of residue remains. To the residue, add a 10-milliliter portion of isooctane and reevaporate to 1 milliliter of hexadecane. Again, add 10 milliliters of isooctane to the residue and evaporate to 1 milliliter of hexadecane to insure complete removal of all volatile materials. Dissolve the 1 milliliter of hexadecane in isooctane and make to 25-milliliter volume. Determine the reference. The absorbance of the solution should not exceed 0.02 per centimeter path length in the 280 mµ-400 mµ range. (<E T="04">Note.</E> Difficulty in meeting this absorbance specification may be due to organic impurities in the distilled water. Repetition of the test omitting the dimethyl sulfoxide will disclose their presence. If necessary to meet the specification, purify the water by redistillation, passage through an ion-exchange resin, or otherwise.)
</P>
<P>Purify, if necessary, by the following procedure: To 1,500 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 2-liter glass-stoppered flask, add 6.0 milliliters of phosphoric acid and 50 grams of Norit A (decolorizing carbon, alkaline) or equivalent. Stopper the flask, and with the use of a magnetic stirrer (tetrafluoroethylene polymer coated bar) stir the solvent for 15 minutes. Filter the dimethyl sulfoxide through four thicknesses of fluted paper (18.5 centimeters, Schleicher &amp; Schuell, No. 597, or equivalent). If the initial filtrate contains carbon fines, refilter through the same filter until a clear filtrate is obtained. Protect the sulfoxide from air and moisture during this operation by covering the solvent in the funnel and collection flask with a layer of isooctane. Transfer the filtrate to a 2-liter separatory funnel and draw off the dimethyl sulfoxide into the 2-liter distillation flask of the vacuum distillation assembly and distill at approximately 3-millimeter Hg pressure or less. Discard the first 200-milliliter fraction of the distillate and replace the distillate collection flask with a clean one. Continue the distillation until approximately 1 liter of the sulfoxide has been collected.
</P>
<P>At completion of the distillation, the reagent should be stored in glass-stoppered bottles since it is very hygroscopic and will react with some metal containers in the presence of air.
</P>
<P><I>Phosphoric acid.</I> 85 percent A.C.S. reagent grade.
</P>
<P><I>Sodium borohydride.</I> 98 percent.
</P>
<P><I>Magnesium oxide</I> (<I>Sea Sorb 43, Food Machinery Company, Westvaco Division, distributed by chemical supply firms, or equivalent</I>). Place 100 grams of the magnesium oxide in a large beaker, add 700 milliliters of distilled water to make a thin slurry, and heat on a steam bath for 30 minutes with intermittent stirring. Stir well initially to insure that all the absorbent is completely wetted. Using a Buchner funnel and a filter paper (Schleicher &amp; Schuell No. 597, or equivalent) of suitable diameter, filter with suction. Continue suction until water no longer drips from the funnel. Transfer the absorbent to a glass trough lined with aluminum foil (free from rolling oil). Break up the magnesia with a clean spatula and spread out the absorbent on the aluminum foil in a layer about 1 centimeter to 2 centimeters thick. Dry for 24 hours at 160 °C ±1 °C. Pulverize the magnesia with mortar and pestle. Sieve the pulverized absorbent between 60-180 mesh. Use the magnesia retained on the 180-mesh sieve.
</P>
<P><I>Celite 545.</I> Johns-Manville Company, diatomaceous earth, or equivalent.
</P>
<P><I>Magnesium oxide-Celite 545 mixture</I> (<I>2</I> + <I>1</I>) <I>by weight.</I> Place the magnesium oxide (60-180 mesh) and the Celite 545 in 2 to 1 proportions, respectively, by weight in a glass-stoppered flask large enough for adequate mixing. Shake vigorously for 10 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a glass trough lined with aluminum foil (free from rolling oil) and spread it out on a layer about 1 centimeter to 2 centimeters thick. Reheat the mixture at 160 °C ±1 °C for 2 hours, and store in a tightly closed flask.
</P>
<P><I>Sodium sulfate, anhydrous, A.C.S. reagent grade, preferably in granular form.</I> For each bottle of sodium sulfate reagent used, establish as follows the necessary sodium sulfate prewash to provide such filters required in the method: Place approximately 35 grams of anhydrous sodium sulfate in a 30-milliliter coarse, fritted-glass funnel or in a 65-millimeter filter funnel with glass wool plug; wash with successive 15-milliliter portions of the indicated solvent until a 15-milliliter portion of the wash shows 0.00 absorbance per centimeter path length between 280 mµ and 400 mµ when tested as prescribed under “Organic solvents.” Usually three portions of wash solvent are sufficient.
</P>
<P>Before proceeding with analysis of a sample, determine the absorbance in a 5-centimeter path cell between 250 mµ and 400 mµ for the reagent blank by carrying out the procedure, without a wax sample, at room temperature, recording the spectra after the extraction stage and after the complete procedure as prescribed. The absorbance per centimeter path length following the extraction stage should not exceed 0.040 in the wavelength range from 280 mµ to 400 mµ; the absorbance per centimeter path length following the complete procedure should not exceed 0.070 in the wavelength range from 280 mµ to 299 mµ, inclusive, nor 0.045 in the wavelength range from 300 mµ to 400 mµ. If in either spectrum the characteristic benzene peaks in the 250 mµ-260 mµ region are present, remove the benzene by the procedure under “Organic solvents” and record absorbance again.
</P>
<P>Place 300 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 1-liter separatory funnel and add 75 milliliters of phosphoric acid. Mix the contents of the funnel and allow to stand for 10 minutes. (The reaction between the sulfoxide and the acid is exothermic. Release pressure after mixing, then keep funnel stoppered.) Add 150 milliliters of isooctane and shake to preequilibrate the solvents. Draw off the individual layers and store in glass-stoppered flasks.
</P>
<P>Place a representative 1-kilogram sample of wax, or if this amount is not available, the entire sample, in a beaker of a capacity about three times the volume of the sample and heat with occasional stirring on a steam bath until the wax is completely melted and homogeneous. Weigh four 25-gram ±0.2 gram portions of the melted wax in separate 100-milliliter beakers. Reserve three of the portions for later replicate analyses as necessary. Pour one weighed portion immediately after remelting (on the steam bath) into a 500-milliliter separatory funnel containing 100 milliliters of the preequilibrated sulfoxide-phosphoric acid mixture that has been heated in the heating jacket at a temperature just high enough to keep the wax melted. (<E T="04">Note:</E> In preheating the sulfoxide-acid mixture, remove the stopper of the separatory funnel at intervals to release the pressure.)
</P>
<P>Promptly complete the transfer of the sample to the funnel in the jacket with portions of the preequilibrated isooctane, warming the beaker, if necessary, and using a total volume of just 50 milliliters of the solvent. If the wax comes out of solution during these operations, let the stoppered funnel remain in the jacket until the wax redissolves. (Remove stopper from the funnel at intervals to release pressure.) When the wax is in solution, remove the funnel from the jacket and shake it vigorously for 2 minutes. Set up three 250-milliliter separatory funnels with each containing 30 milliliters of preequilibrated isooctane. After separation of the liquid phases, allow to cool until the main portion of the wax-isooctane solution begins to show a precipitate. Gently swirl the funnel when precipitation first occurs on the inside surface of the funnel to accelerate this process. Carefully draw off the lower layer, filter it slowly through a thin layer of glass wool fitted loosely in a filter funnel into the first 250-milliliter separatory funnel, and wash in tandem with the 30-milliliter portions of isooctane contained in the 250-milliliter separatory funnels. Shaking time for each wash is 1 minute. Repeat the extraction operation with two additional portions of the sulfoxide-acid mixture, replacing the funnel in the jacket after each extraction to keep the wax in solution and washing each extractive in tandem through the same three portions of isooctane. 
</P>
<P>Collect the successive extractives (300 milliliters total) in a separatory funnel (preferably 2-liter), containing 480 milliliters of distilled water, mix, and allow to cool for a few minutes after the last extractive has been added. Add 80 milliliters of isooctane to the solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes. Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second separatory funnel (preferably 2-liter) and repeat the extraction with 80 milliliters of isooctane. Draw off and discard the aqueous layer. Wash each of the 80-milliliter extractives three times with 100-milliliter portions of distilled water. Shaking time for each wash is 1 minute. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extractive through anhydrous sodium sulfate prewashed with isooctane (see <I>Sodium Sulfate</I> under “Reagents and Materials” for preparation of filter) into a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into the evaporation flask). Wash the first separatory funnel with the second 80-milliliter isooctane extractive and pass through the sodium sulfate. Then wash the second and first separatory funnels successively with a 20-milliliter portion of isooctane and pass the solvent through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Add 1 milliliter of <I>n-</I>hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under nitrogen. Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 milliliter of residue remains. To the residue, add a 10-milliliter portion of isooctane, reevaporate to 1 milliliter of hexadecane, and repeat this operation once.
</P>
<P>Quantitatively transfer the residue with isooctane to a 25-milliliter volumetric flask, make to volume, and mix. Determine the absorbance of the solution in the 5-centimeter path length cells compared to isooctane as reference between 280 mµ-400 mµ (take care to lose none of the solution in filling the sample cell). Correct the absorbance values for any absorbance derived from reagents as determined by carrying out the procedure without a wax sample. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits prescribed in this paragraph (b), the wax meets the ultraviolet absorbance specifications. If the corrected absorbance per centimeter path length exceeds the limits prescribed in this paragraph (b), proceed as follows:
</P>
<P>Quantitatively transfer the isooctane solution to a 125-milliliter flask equipped with 24/40 joint and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under a stream of nitrogen to a volume of 1 milliliter of hexadecane. Add 10 milliliters of methyl alcohol and approximately 0.3 gram of sodium borohydride. (Minimize exposure of the borohydride to the atmosphere. A measuring dipper may be used.) Immediately fit a water-cooled condenser equipped with a 24/40 joint and with a drying tube into the flask, mix until the borohydride is dissolved, and allow to stand for 30 minutes at room temperature, with intermittent swirling. At the end of this period, disconnect the flask and evaporate the methyl alcohol on the steam bath under nitrogen until the sodium borohydride begins to come out of the solution. Then add 10 milliliters of isooctane and evaporate to a volume of about 2-3 milliliters. Again, add 10 milliliters of isooctane and concentrate to a volume of approximately 5 milliliters. Swirl the flask repeatedly to assure adequate washing of the sodium borohydride residues.
</P>
<P>Fit the tetrafluoroethylene polymer disc on the upper part of the stem of the chromatographic tube, then place the tube with the disc on the suction flask and apply the vacuum (approximately 135 millimeters Hg pressure). Weight out 14 grams of the 2:1 magnesium oxide-Celite 545 mixture and pour the adsorbent mixture into the chromatographic tube in approximately 3-centimeter layers. After the addition of each layer, level off the top of the adsorbent with a flat glass rod or metal plunger by pressing down firmly until the adsorbent is well packed. Loosen the topmost few millimeters of each adsorbent layer with the end of a metal rod before the addition of the next layer. Continue packing in this manner until all the 14 grams of the adsorbent is added to the tube. Level off the top of the adsorbent by pressing down firmly with a flat glass rod or metal plunger to make the depth of the adsorbent bed approximately 12.5 centimeters in depth. Turn off the vacuum and remove the suction flask. Fit the 500-milliliter reservoir onto the top of the chromatographic column and prewet the column by passing 100 milliliters of isooctane through the column. Adjust the nitrogen pressure so that the rate of descent of the isooctane coming off of the column is between 2-3 milliliters per minute. Discontinue pressure just before the last of the isooctane reaches the level of the adsorbent. (<E T="04">Caution:</E> Do not allow the liquid level to recede below the adsorbent level at any time.) Remove the reservoir and decant the 5-milliliter isooctane concentrate solution onto the column and with slight pressure again allow the liquid level to recede to barely above the adsorbent level. Rapidly complete the transfer similarly with two 5-milliliter portions of isooctane, swirling the flask repeatedly each time to assure adequate washing of the residue. Just before the final 5-milliliter wash reaches the top of the adsorbent, add 100 milliliters of isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at the 2-3 milliliter per minute rate. Just before the last of the isooctane reaches the adsorbent level, add 100 milliliters of 10 percent benzene in isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at the aforementioned rate. Just before the solvent mixture reaches adsorbent level, add 25 milliliters of 20 percent benzene in isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at 2-3 milliliters per minute until all this solvent mixture has been removed from the column. Discard all the elution solvents collected up to this point. Add 300 milliliters of the acetone-benzene-water mixture to the reservoir and percolate through the column to elute the polynuclear compounds. Collect the eluate in a clean 1-liter separatory funnel. Allow the column to drain until most of the solvent mixture is removed. Wash the eluate three times with 300-milliliter portions of distilled water, shaking well for each wash. (The addition of small amounts of sodium chloride facilitates separation.) Discard the aqueous layer after each wash. After the final separation, filter the residual benzene through anhydrous sodium sulfate prewashed with benzene (see <I>Sodium sulfate</I> under “Reagents and Materials” for preparation of filter) into a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into the evaporation flask). Wash the separatory funnel with two additional 20-milliliter portions of benzene which are also filtered through the sodium sulfate. Add 1 milliliter of <I>n-</I>hexadecane and completely remove the benzene by evaporation under nitrogen, using the special procedure to eliminate benzene as previously described under “Organic Solvents.” Quantitatively transfer the residue with isooctane to a 25-milliliter volumetric flask and adjust to volume. Determine the absorbance of the solution in the 5-centimeter path length cells compared to isooctane as reference between 250 mµ-400 mµ. Correct for any absorbance derived from the reagents as determined by carrying out the procedure without a wax sample. If either spectrum shows the characteristic benzene peaks in the 250 mµ-260 mµ region, evaporate the solution to remove benzene by the procedure under “Organic Solvents.” Dissolve the residue, transfer quantitatively, and adjust to volume in isooctane in a 25-milliliter volumetric flask. Record the absorbance again. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits prescribed in this paragraph (b), the wax meets the ultraviolet absorbance specifications.</P></EXTRACT>

Total extractives, minus ash equals the organic extractives. If the organic extractives are greater than 1 part per million of the solvent used, a blank should be run on the solvent and a correction should be made by subtracting the total extractives obtained with the blank from the total extractives obtained in the resin test. The solvents used are to be made as follows:

<EXTRACT>
<FP-1>Distilled water (de-ionized water is distilled).

<FP-1>5 percent acetic acid made by mixing 5 parts by weight of A.C.S. reagent grade glacial acetic acid with 95 parts by weight of distilled de-ionized water.</FP-1></EXTRACT>
<FP>In addition to the organic extractives limitation prescribed in this paragraph, the ion-exchange resin identified in paragraph (a)(17) of this section, when extracted with each of the named solvents, distilled water, 50 percent alcohol, and 5 percent acetic acid, will be found to result in not more than 7 parts per million of nitrogen extractives (calculated as nitrogen) when the resin in the free-base form is subjected to the following test immediately before each use: Using a separate 1-inch diameter glass ion-exchange column for each solvent, prepare each column using 100 milliliters of ready to use ion-exchange resin that is to be tested. With the bottom outlet closed, fill each ion-exchange column with one of the three solvents at a temperature of 25 °C until the solvent level is even with the top of the resin bed. Seal each column at the top and bottom and store in a vertical position at a temperature of 25 °C. After 96 hours, open the top of each column, drain the solvent into a collection vessel, and analyze each drained solvent and a solvent blank for nitrogen by a standard micro-Kjeldahl method.

<HD1>Analytical Procedure for Citric Acid
</HD1>
<HD1>general instructions
</HD1>
<P>Because of the sensitivity of the test, the possibility of errors arising from contamination is great. It is of the greatest importance that all glassware be scrupulously cleaned to remove all organic matter such as oil, grease, detergent residues, etc. Examine all glassware including stoppers and stopcocks, under ultraviolet light to detect any residual fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care to avoid contamination of citric acid samples in handling is essential to assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate packaging. Because some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this test are very susceptible to photo-oxidation, the entire procedure is to be carried out under subdued light.

Activate as follows: Slurry 900 grams of silica gel reagent with 2 liters of purified water in a 3-liter beaker. Cool the mixture and pour into a 80 × 900 chromatographic column with coarse fritted disc. Drain the water, wash with an additional 6 liters of purified water and wash with 3,600 milliliters of purified methyl alcohol at a relatively slow rate. Drain all of the solvents and transfer the silica gel to an aluminum foil-lined drying dish. Place foil over the top of the dish. Activate in a vacuum oven at low vacuum (approximately 750 millimeters Mercury or 27 inches of Mercury below atmospheric pressure) at 173° to 177 °C for at least 20 hours. Cool under vacuum and store in an amber bottle.
</P>
<P><I>Sodium sulfate, anhydrous, A.C.S. reagent grade.</I> This reagent should be washed with purified isooctane. Check the purity of this reagent as described in § 172.886 of this chapter.
</P>
<P><I>Water, purified.</I> All water used must meet the specifications of the following test:
</P>
<P>Extract 600 milliliters of water with 50 milliliters of purified isooctane. Add 1 milliliter of purified <I>n-</I>hexadecane to the isooctane extract and evaporate the resulting solution to 1 milliliter. The absorbance of this residue shall not exceed 0.02 per centimeter path length between 300-400 nanometers and 0.03 per centimeter path length between 280-299 nanometers. If necessary, water may be purified by distillation, extraction with purified organic solvents, treatment with an absorbent (e.g., activated carbon) followed by filtration of the absorbent or otherwise.
</P>
<HD1>procedure
</HD1>
<P>Separate portions of 200 milliliters of purified water are taken through the procedure for use as control blanks. Each citric acid sample is processed as follows: Weigh 200 grams of anhydrous citric acid into a 500 milliliter flask and dissolve in 200 milliliters of pure water. Heat the solution to 60 °C and transfer to a 500 milliliter separatory funnel. Rinse the flask with 50 milliliters of isooctane and add the isooctane to the separatory funnel. Gently shake the mixture 90 times (caution: vigorous shaking will cause emulsions) with periodic release of the pressure caused by shaking.
</P>
<P>Allow the phases to separate for at least 5 minutes. Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second 500-milliliter separatory funnel and repeat the extraction with a second aliquot of 50 milliliters of isooctane. After separation of the layers, draw off and discard the water layer. Combine both isooctane extracts in the funnel containing the first extract. Rinse the funnel which contained the second extract with 10 milliliters of isooctane and add this portion to the combined isooctane extract.
</P>
<P>A chromatographic column containing 5.5 grams of silica gel and 3 grams of anhydrous sodium sulfate is prepared for each citric acid sample as follows: Fit 18 × 300 column with a small glass wool plug. Rinse the inside of the column with 10 milliliters of purified isooctane. Drain the isooctane from the column. Pour 5.5 grams of activated silica gel into the column. Tap the column approximately 20 times on a semisoft, clean surface to settle the silica gel. Carefully pour 3 grams of anhydrous sodium sulfate onto the top of the silica gel in the column.
</P>
<P>Carefully drain the isooctane extract of the citric acid solution into the column in a series of additions while the isooctane is draining from the column at an elution rate of approximately 3 milliliters per minute. Rinse the separatory funnel with 10 milliliters of isooctane after the last portion of the extract has been applied to the column and add this rinse to the column. After all of the extract has been applied to the column and the solvent layer reaches the top of the sulfate bed, rinse the column with 25 milliliters of isooctane followed by 10 milliliters of a 10-percent dichloroethane in hexane solution. For each rinse solution, drain the column until the solvent layer reaches the top of the sodium sulfate bed. Discard the rinse solvents. Place a 250-milliliter round bottom flask containing 0.5 milliliter of purified <I>n-</I>hexadecane under the column. Elute the polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons from the column with 30 milliliters of 40-percent benzene in hexane solution. Drain the eluate until the 40-percent benzene in the hexane solvent reaches the top of the sodium sulfate bed.
</P>
<P>Evaporate the 40-percent benzene in hexane eluate on the rotary vacuum evaporator at 45 °C until only the <I>n-</I>hexadecane residue of 0.5 milliliter remains. Treat the <I>n-</I>hexadecane residue twice with the following wash step: Add 6 milliliters of purified isooctane and remove the solvents by vacuum evaporation at 45 °C to constant volume, i.e., 0.5 milliliter. Cool the <I>n-</I>hexadecane residue and transfer the solution to an 0.5-milliliter microcuvette. Determine the absorbance of this solution compared to purified <I>n-</I>hexadecane as reference. Correct the absorbance values for any absorbance derived from the control reagent blank. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits prescribed, the samples meet the ultraviolet absorbance specifications.
</P>
<P>The reagent blank is prepared by using 200 milliliters of purified water in place of the citric acid solution and carrying the water sample through the procedure. The typical control reagent blank should not exceed 0.03 absorbance per centimeter path length between 280 and 299 nanometers, 0.02 absorbance per centimeter path length between 300 and 359 nanometers, and 0.01 absorbance per centimeter path length between 360 and 400 nanometers.</P></EXTRACT>

The asterisk shall refer to a notation at the bottom of the page which shall state “This drug has been evaluated as probably effective (or possibly effective whichever is appropriate) for this indication” and “See Brief Summary” or “See Prescribing Information,” the latter legend to be used only if the advertisement carries the required information for professional use as set forth in § 201.100(c)(1).

The Food and Drug Administration will identify these situations in direct correspondence with the drug promoters, after which the failure to make the disclosure will be regarded as misleading and appropriate action will be taken.

<HEAD>§ 201.300   Notice to manufacturers, packers, and distributors of glandular preparations.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Under date of December 4, 1941, in a notice to manufacturers of glandular preparations, the Food and Drug Administration expressed the opinion that preparations of inert glandular materials intended for medicinal use should, in view of the requirement of section 201(n) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (52 Stat. 1041; 21 U.S.C. 321(n)), be labeled with a statement of the material fact that there is no scientific evidence that the articles contain any therapeutic or physiologically active constituents. Numerous preparations of such inert glandular materials were subsequently marketed with disclaimers of the type suggested. The term <I>inert glandular materials</I> means preparations incapable of exerting an action or effect of some significant or measurable benefit in one way or another, i.e., in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or in affecting the structure or any function of the body.
</P>
<P>(b) Manufacturers have heretofore taken advantage of § 201.100 permitting omission of directions for use when the label bears the prescription legend. Section 201.100(c) requires that the labeling of the drug, which may include brochures readily available to licensed practitioners, bear information as to the use of the drug by practitioners licensed by law to administer it. Obviously, information adequate for the use of an inert glandular preparation is not available to practitioners licensed by law.
</P>
<P>(c) The Department of Health and Human Services is of the opinion that inert glandular materials may not be exempted from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) of the act that they bear adequate directions for use; and, accordingly, that their labeling must include among other things, representations as to the conditions for which such articles are intended to be used or as to the structure or function of the human body that they are intended to affect. Since any such representations offering these articles for use as drugs would be false or misleading, such articles will be considered to be misbranded if they are distributed for use as drugs.
</P>
<P>(d) The amended regulations provide also that in the case of drugs intended for parenteral administration there shall be no exemption from the requirement that their labelings bear adequate directions for use. Such inert glandular materials for parenteral use are therefore subject to the same comment as applies to those intended for oral administration.

<HEAD>§ 201.301   Notice to manufacturers, packers, and distributors of estrogenic hormone preparations.</HEAD>
<P>Some drug preparations fabricated wholly or in part from estradiol and labeled as to potency in terms of international units or in terms of international units of estrone activity have been marketed. The international unit of the estrus-producing hormone was established by the International Conference on the Standardization of Sex Hormones at London, England, on August 1, 1932. This unit was defined as “the specific estrus-producing activity contained in 0.1 gamma ( = 0.0001 mg.) of the standard” hydroxyketonic hormone found in urine (estrone). The International Conference declared that it did not recommend the determination of the activity of nonhydroxyketonic forms of estrogenic hormones in units of estrone because of the varying ratios between the activity of such nonhydroxyketonic estrogenic hormones and estrone, when measured by different methods on test animals. There is no international unit for measuring the activity of estradiol and no accepted relationship between its activity and that of estrone, either in test animals or in humans. The declaration of potency of estradiol in terms of international units or in terms of international units of estrone activity is therefore considered misleading, within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 352(a). The declaration of the estradiol content of an estrogenic hormone preparation in terms of weight is considered appropriate.

<HEAD>§ 201.302   Notice to manufacturers, packers, and distributors of drugs for internal use which contain mineral oil.</HEAD>
<P>(a) In the past few years research studies have altered medical opinion as to the usefulness and harmfulness of mineral oil in the human body. These studies have indicated that when mineral oil is used orally near mealtime it interferes with absorption from the digestive tract of provitamin A and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and K, and consequently interferes with the utilization of calcium and phosphorus, with the result that the user is left liable to deficiency diseases. When so used in pregnancy it predisposes to hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.
</P>
<P>(b) There is accumulated evidence that the indiscriminate administration of mineral oil to infants may be followed by aspiration of the mineral oil and subsequent “lipoid pneumonia.”
</P>
<P>(c) In view of these facts, the Department of Health and Human Services will regard as misbranded under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act a drug for oral administration consisting in whole or in part of mineral oil, the labeling of which encourages its use in pregnancy or indicates or implies that such drug is for administration to infants.
</P>
<P>(d) It is also this Department's view that the act requires the labelings of such drugs to bear a warning against consumption other than at bedtime and against administration to infants. The following form of warning is suggested: “Caution: To be taken only at bedtime. Do not use at any other time or administer to infants, except upon the advice of a physician.”
</P>
<P>(e) This statement of interpretation does not in any way exempt mineral oil or preparations containing mineral oil from complying in all other respects with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

<HEAD>§ 201.303   Labeling of drug preparations containing significant proportions of wintergreen oil.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Because methyl salicylate (wintergreen oil) manifests no toxicity in the minute amounts in which it is used as a flavoring, it is mistakenly regarded by the public as harmless even when taken in substantially larger amounts. Actually, it is quite toxic when taken in quantities of a teaspoonful or more. Wintergreen oil and preparations containing it have caused a number of deaths through accidental misuse by both adults and children. Children are particularly attracted by the odor and are likely to swallow these products when left within reach.
</P>
<P>(b) To safeguard against fatalities from this cause, the Department of Health and Human Services will regard as misbranded under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act any drug containing more than 5 percent methyl salicylate (wintergreen oil), the labeling of which fails to warn that use otherwise than as directed therein may be dangerous and that the article should be kept out of reach of children to prevent accidental poisoning.

<HEAD>§ 201.304   Tannic acid and barium enema preparations.</HEAD>
<P>(a) It has become a widespread practice for tannic acid to be added to barium enemas to improve X-ray pictures. Tannic acid is capable of causing diminished liver function and severe liver necrosis when absorbed in sufficient amounts. The medical literature reports a number of deaths associated with the addition of tannic acid to barium enemas. There is a lack of scientific evidence to establish the conditions, if any, under which tannic acid is safe and effective for use in enemas. Tannic acid for rectal use to enhance X-ray visualization is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P>(b) In view of the hazards involved when tannic acid is used in barium enemas, any shipments of tannic acid labeled to come within the exemptions under 502(f) of the Act containing such phrases as: “Caution: For manufacturing, processing, or repackaging,” “For prescription compounding,” or “Diagnostic reagent—For professional use only” will be regarded by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs as misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act unless the label and the labeling bear conspicuously a warning to the effect: “<I>Warning—</I> Not for use in enemas.”

<HEAD>§ 201.305   Isoproterenol inhalation preparations (pressurized aerosols, nebulizers, powders) for human use; warnings.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Accumulating reports have been received by the Food and Drug Administration and have appeared in the medical literature of severe paradoxical bronchoconstriction associated with repeated, excessive use of isoproterenol inhalation preparations in the treatment of bronchial asthma and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders. The cause of this paradoxical reaction is unknown; it has been observed, however, that patients have not responded completely to other forms of therapy until use of the isoproterenol inhalation preparation was discontinued. In addition, sudden unexpected deaths have been associated with the excessive use of isoproterenol inhalation preparations. The mechanism of these deaths and their relationship, if any, to the cases of severe paradoxical bronchospasm are not clear. Cardiac arrest was noted in several of these cases of sudden death.
</P>
<P>(b) On the basis of the above information and after discussion with and concurrence of the Respiratory and Anesthetic Drugs Advisory Committee for Food and Drug Administration, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs concludes that in order for the labeling of such drugs to bear adequate information for their safe use, as required by § 201.100, such labeling must include the following:
</P>
<EXTRACT>
<P><I>Warning:</I> Occasional patients have been reported to develop severe paradoxical airway resistance with repeated, excessive use of isoproterenol inhalation preparations. The cause of this refractory state is unknown. It is advisable that in such instances the use of this preparation be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted, since in the reported cases the patients did not respond to other forms of therapy until the drug was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>Deaths have been reported following excessive use of isoproterenol inhalation preparations and the exact cause is unknown. Cardiac arrest was noted in several instances.</P></EXTRACT>
<P>(c)(1) The Commissioner also concludes that in view of the manner in which these preparations are self-administered for relief of attacks of bronchial asthma and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders, it is necessary for the protection of users that warning information to patients be included as a part of the label and as part of any instructions to patients included in the package dispensed to the patient as follows:
</P>
<EXTRACT>
<P><I>Warning:</I> Do not exceed the dose prescribed by your physician. If difficulty in breathing persists, contact your physician immediately.</P></EXTRACT>
<P>(2) The warning on the label may be accomplished (i) by including it on the immediate container label with a statement directed to pharmacists not to remove the label or (ii) by including in the package a printed warning with instructions to pharmacists to place the warning on the container prior to dispensing.
</P>
<P>(d) The marketing of isoproterenol inhalation preparations may be continued if all the following conditions are met:
</P>
<P>(1) Within 30 days following the date of publication of this section in the <E T="04">Federal Register:</E>
</P>
<P>(i) The label and labeling of such preparations shipped within the jurisdiction of the act are in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) The holder of an approved new-drug application for such preparation submits a supplement to his new-drug application to provide for appropriate labeling changes as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) Within 90 days following the date of publication of this section in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of any drug containing isoproterenol intended for inhalation for which a new-drug approval is not in effect submits a new-drug application containing satisfactory information of the kinds required by § 314.50 of this chapter, including appropriate labeling as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) The applicant submits additional information required for the approval of the application as may be specified in a written communication from the Food and Drug Administration.

</P>
<EXTRACT>
<P><I>Warning</I>—There have been several reports, published and unpublished, concerning nonspecific small-bowel lesions consisting of stenosis, with or without ulceration, associated with the administration of enteric-coated thiazides with potassium salts. These lesions may occur with enteric-coated potassium tablets alone or when they are used with nonenteric-coated thiazides, or certain other oral diuretics. These small-bowel lesions have caused obstruction, hemorrhage, and perforation. Surgery was frequently required and deaths have occurred. Based on a large survey of physicians and hospitals, both United States and foreign, the incidence of these lesions is low, and a causal relationship in man has not been definitely established. Available information tends to implicate enteric-coated potassium salts, although lesions of this type also occur spontaneously. Therefore, coated potassium-containing formulations should be administered only when indicated, and should be discontinued immediately if abdominal pain, distention, nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding occur. Coated potassium tablets should be used only when adequate dietary supplementation is not practicable.</P></EXTRACT>
<FP>(Although the warning statement includes references to enteric-coated potassium salt preparations, it applies to any capsule or coated tablet of a potassium salt intended for oral ingestion without prior dilution with an adequate volume of liquid to preclude gastrointestinal injury.)

<HEAD>§ 201.307   Sodium phosphates; package size limitation, warnings, and directions for over-the-counter sale.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Reports in the medical literature and data accumulated by the Food and Drug Administration indicate that multiple container sizes of sodium phosphates oral solution available in the marketplace have caused consumer confusion and appear to have been involved in several consumer deaths. Sodium phosphates oral solution has been marketed in 45-milliliter (mL), 90-mL, and 240-mL container sizes. The 45-mL and 90-mL container sizes of sodium phosphates oral solution are often recommended and prescribed by physicians for bowel cleansing prior to surgery and diagnostic procedures of the colon. Sodium phosphates oral solution (adult dose 20 mL to 45 mL) is also used as an over-the-counter (OTC) laxative for the relief of occasional constipation. Accidental overdosing and deaths have occurred because the 240-mL container was mistakenly used instead of the 45-mL or 90-mL container. The Food and Drug Administration is limiting the amount of sodium phosphates oral solution to not more than 90 mL (3 ounces (oz)) per OTC container because of the serious health risks associated with the ingestion of larger than intended doses of this product. Further, because an overdose of either oral or rectal enema sodium phosphates can cause an electrolyte imbalance, additional warning and direction statements are required for the safe use of any OTC laxative drug product containing sodium phosphates.
</P>
<P>(b) Any OTC drug product for laxative or bowel cleansing use containing sodium phosphates as an active ingredient when marketed as described in paragraph (a) of this section is misbranded within the meaning of section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act unless packaged and labeled as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) Package size limitation for sodium phosphates oral solution: Container shall not contain more than 90 mL (3 oz).
</P>
<P>(2) Warnings. The following sentences shall appear in boldface type as the first statement under the heading “Warnings.”
</P>
<P>(i) Oral dosage forms. “Taking more than the recommended dose in 24 hours can be harmful.”
</P>
<P>(ii) Rectal enema dosage forms. “Using more than one enema in 24 hours can be harmful.”
</P>
<P>(3) Directions—(i) The labeling of all orally or rectally administered OTC drug products containing sodium phosphates shall contain the following directions in boldface type immediately preceding the dosage information: “Do not” (“take” or “use”) “more unless directed by a doctor. See Warnings.”
</P>
<P>(ii) For products containing dibasic sodium phosphate/monobasic sodium phosphate identified in § 334.16(d) marketed as a solution. Adults and children 12 years of age and over: Oral dosage is dibasic sodium phosphate 3.42 to 7.56 grams (g) and monobasic sodium phosphate 9.1 to 20.2 g (20 to 45 mL dibasic sodium phosphate/monobasic sodium phosphate oral solution) as a single daily dose. “Do not take more than 45 mL (9 teaspoonfuls or 3 tablespoonfuls) in a 24-hour period.” Children 10 and 11 years of age: Oral dosage is dibasic sodium phosphate 1.71 to 3.78 g and monobasic sodium phosphate 4.5 to 10.1 g (10 to 20 mL dibasic sodium phosphate/monobasic sodium phosphate oral solution) as a single daily dose. “Do not take more than 20 mL (4 teaspoonfuls) in a 24-hour period.” Children 5 to 9 years of age: Oral dosage is dibasic sodium phosphate 0.86 to 1.89 g and monobasic sodium phosphate 2.2 to 5.05 g (5 to 10 mL dibasic sodium phosphate/monobasic sodium phosphate oral solution) as a single daily dose. “Do not take more than 10 mL (2 teaspoonfuls) in a 24-hour period.” Children under 5 years of age: ask a doctor.

<HEAD>§ 201.308   Ipecac syrup; warnings and directions for use for over-the-counter sale.</HEAD>
<P>(a) It is estimated that each year about 500,000 accidental poisonings occur in the United States and result in approximately 1,500 deaths, of which over 400 are children. In the emergency treatment of these poisonings, ipecac syrup is considered the emetic of choice. The immediate availability of this drug for use in such situations is critical, since rapid treatment may be the difference between life and death. The restriction of this drug to prescription sale limits its availability in emergencies. On the other hand, it is the consensus of informed medical opinion that ipecac syrup should be used only under medical supervision in the emergency treatment of poisonings. In view of these facts, the question of whether ipecac syrup labeled as an emergency treatment for use in poisonings should be available over the counter has been controversial.
</P>
<P>(b) In connection with its study of this problem, the Food and Drug Administration has obtained the views of medical authorities. It is the unanimous recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Poison Control Centers, the American Medical Association, and the Medical Advisory Board of the Food and Drug Administration that ipecac syrup in 1 fluid ounce containers be permitted to be sold without prescription so that it will be readily available in the household for emergency treatment of poisonings, under medical supervision, and that the drug be appropriately packaged and labeled for this purpose.
</P>
<P>(c) In view of the above recommendations, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has determined that it is in the interest of the public health for ipecac syrup to be available for sale without prescription, provided that it is packaged in a quantity of 1 fluid ounce (30 milliliters), and its label bears, in addition to other required label information, the following, in a prominent and conspicuous manner:
</P>
<P>(1) A statement conspicuously boxed and in red letters, to the effect: “For emergency use to cause vomiting in poisoning. Before using, call physician, the Poison Control Center, or hospital emergency room immediately for advice.”
</P>
<P>(2) A warning to the effect: “Warning—Keep out of reach of children. Do not use in unconscious persons. Ordinarily, this drug should not be used if strychnine, corrosives such as alkalies (lye) and strong acids, or petroleum distillates such as kerosine, gasoline, coal oil, fuel oil, paint thinner, or cleaning fluid have been ingested.”

<P>(a) In 1961, the Food and Drug Administration, pursuant to its statutory responsibility for the safety and effectiveness of drugs shipped in interstate commerce, began an active investigation of reports of possible toxic effects and renal damage due to misuse of the drug acetophenetidin. This study led to the decision that there was probable cause to conclude that misuse and prolonged use of the drug were in fact responsible for kidney lesions and disease. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in December 1963, appointed an ad hoc Advisory Committee of Inquiry on Possible Nephrotoxicity Associated With the Abuse of Acetophenetidin (Phenacetin)-Containing Preparations. This committee, composed of scientists in the fields of pharmacology and medicine, on April 23, 1964, submitted its findings and conclusions in the matter and recommended that all acetophenetidin (phenacetin)-containing preparations bear a warning as provided in section 502(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P>(b) On the basis of the studies made by the Food and Drug Administration and the report of the Advisory Committee, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that it is necessary for the protection of users that the label and labeling of all acetophenetidin (phenacetin)-containing preparations bear a warning statement to the following effect: “Warning—This medication may damage the kidneys when used in large amounts or for a long period of time. Do not take more than the recommended dosage, nor take regularly for longer than 10 days without consulting your physician.”

There are also reports implicating the drug in cases of hepatitis and hypersensitivity reactions. In view of the potentially serious effects found to be associated with preparations of this drug intended for use by man, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs will regard such preparations as misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f) (1) and (2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, unless the label and labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed, and any other labeling furnishing or purporting to furnish information for use of the drug, bear a conspicuous warning statement to the following effect: “Warning: Agranulocytosis and hepatitis have been associated with the use of phenindione.

In case of overdose, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away,” or “Keep out of reach of children [highlighted in bold type],” except that if the article is an aspirin preparation, it shall bear the first of these warning statements. Such a warning statement is required for compliance with section 502(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and is intended to guard against accidental poisonings. Safety closures that prevent access to the drug by young children are also recommended to guard against accidental poisonings.
</P>
<P>(b) Effervescent preparations and preparations containing para-aminosalicylate as the only salicylate ingredient are exempted from this labeling requirement.
</P>
<P>(c) Aspirin tablets sold as such and containing no other active ingredients, except tablets which cannot be readily subdivided into a child's dose because of their coating or size, should always bear dosage directions for each age group down to 3 years of age, with a statement such as “For children under 3 years of age, consult your physician.” It is recommended that:
</P>
<P>(1) Aspirin tablets especially made for pediatric use be produced only in 1

<P>(d) Salicylate preparations other than aspirin tablets sold as such may, at the option of the distributor, be labeled for use by adults only. If their labeling and advertising clearly offer them for administration to adults only.
</P>
<P>(e)(1) It is the obligation of the distributor who labels a salicylate preparation for administration to children to make certain that the article is suitable for such use and labeled with adequate directions for use in the age group for which it is offered, but in no case should such an article bear directions for use in children under 3 years of age. If the directions provide for administration to children as young as 3 years of age, the label should bear the statement, “For children under 3 years of age consult your physician.” However, if the directions provide for administration to children only of an age greater than 3 years (for example, the dosage instructions provide for administration of the article to children only down to age 6), the label should bear a statement such as, “For younger children consult your physician.”
</P>
<P>(2) A statement such as, “For children under 3 years of age consult your physician” or “For younger children consult your physician” is not required on the label of an article clearly offered for administration to adults only.
</P>
<P>(f) If the labeling or advertising of a salicylate preparation offers it for use in arthritis or rheumatism, the label and labeling should clearly state that the beneficial effects claimed are limited to: “For the temporary relief of minor aches and pains of arthritis and rheumatism.” The qualifying phrase “for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains” should appear with the same degree of prominence and conspicuousness as the phrase “arthritis and rheumatism”. The label and labeling should bear in juxtaposition with such directions for use conspicuous warning statements to the effect: “Caution: If pain persists for more than 10 days, or redness is present, or in conditions affecting children under 12 years of age, consult a physician immediately.” The salicylate dosage should not exceed 60 grains in a 24-hour period or 10 grains in a 4-hour period. If the article contains other analgesics, the salicylate dosage should be appropriately reduced.
</P>
<P>(g)(1) The label of any drug containing more than 5 percent methyl salicylate (wintergreen oil) should bear a conspicuous warning such as: “Do not use otherwise than as directed.” These drug products must also include the “Keep out of reach of children” warning and the accidental ingestion warning as required in § 330.1(g) of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(2) If the preparation is a counterirritant or rubefacient, it should also bear a caution such as, “Caution: Discontinue use if excessive irritation of the skin develops. Avoid getting into the eyes or on mucous membranes.” (See also § 201.303.)
</P>
<P>(h)(1) The labeling of orally or rectally administered over-the-counter drug products containing aspirin or nonaspirin salicylates as active ingredients subject to this paragraph is required to prominently bear the following warning: “Reye's syndrome [subheading in bold type]: Children and teenagers who have or are recovering from chicken pox or flu-like symptoms should not use this product. When using this product, if changes in behavior with nausea and vomiting occur, consult a doctor because these symptoms could be an early sign of Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious illness.”
</P>
<P>(2) This warning statement shall appear on the immediate container labeling. In cases where the immediate container is not the retail package, the retail package also must bear the warning statement. In addition, the warning statement shall appear on any labeling that contains warnings and, in such cases, the warning statement shall be the first warning statement under the heading “Warnings.”

<P>(a) Reports in the medical literature and data accumulated by the Food and Drug Administration indicate that esophageal obstruction and asphyxiation have been associated with the ingestion of water-soluble gums, hydrophilic gums, and hydrophilic mucilloids including, but not limited to, agar, alginic acid, calcium polycarbophil, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, carrageenan, chondrus, glucomannan ((B-1,4 linked) polymannose acetate), guar gum, karaya gum, kelp, methylcellulose, plantago seed (psyllium), polycarbophil, tragacanth, and xanthan gum. Esophageal obstruction and asphyxiation due to orally-administered drug products containing water-soluble gums, hydrophilic gums, and hydrophilic mucilloids as active ingredients are significant health risks when these products are taken without adequate fluid or when they are used by individuals with esophageal narrowing or dysfunction, or with difficulty in swallowing. Additional labeling is needed for the safe and effective use of any OTC drug product for human use containing a water-soluble gum, hydrophilic gum, or hydrophilic mucilloid as an active ingredient when marketed in a dry or incompletely hydrated form to include, but not limited to, the following dosage forms: Capsules, granules, powders, tablets, and wafers. Granular dosage forms containing psyllium are not generally recognized as safe and effective as OTC laxatives (see § 310.545(a)(12)(i)(B) of this chapter) and may not be marketed without an approved new drug application because the warnings and directions in paragraph (b) of this section have been found inadequate for these products.

<HEAD>§ 201.325   Over-the-counter drugs for vaginal contraceptive and spermicide use containing nonoxynol 9 as the active ingredient; required warnings and labeling information.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Studies indicate that use of vaginal contraceptive drug products containing nonoxynol 9 does not protect against infection from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or against the transmission of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Studies also indicate that use of vaginal contraceptive drug products containing nonoxynol 9 can increase vaginal irritation, such as the disruption of the vaginal epithelium, and also can cause epithelial disruption when used in the rectum. These effects may increase the risk of transmission of the AIDS virus (HIV) from an infected partner. Therefore, consumers should be warned that these products do not protect against the transmission of the AIDS virus (HIV) or other STDs, that use of these products can increase vaginal and rectal irritation, which may increase the risk of getting the AIDS virus (HIV) from an HIV infected partner, and that the products are not for rectal use. Consumers should also be warned that these products should not be used by persons who have HIV/AIDS or are at high risk for HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>(b) The labeling of OTC vaginal contraceptive and spermicide drug products containing nonoxynol 9 as the active ingredient, whether subject to the ongoing OTC drug review or an approved drug application, must contain the following warnings under the heading “Warnings,” in accordance with 21 CFR 201.66.

</P>
<P>(5) “Stop use and ask a doctor if [in bold type] [optional, bullet] you or your partner get burning, itching, a rash, or other irritation of the vagina or penis”.
</P>
<P>(c) The labeling of this product states under the “Other information” section of the Drug Facts labeling in accordance with § 201.66(c)(7), “[bullet] when used correctly every time you have sex, latex condoms greatly reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

<P>(d) The labeling of this product includes the following statements either on the outside container or wrapper of the retail package, under the “Other information” section of the Drug Facts labeling in accordance with § 201.66(c)(7), or in a package insert:
</P>
<P>(1) “[bullet] studies have raised safety concerns that products containing the spermicide nonoxynol 9 can irritate the vagina and rectum. Sometimes this irritation has no symptoms. This irritation may increase the risk of getting HIV/AIDS from an infected partner”.
</P>
<P>(2) “[bullet] you can use nonoxynol 9 for birth control with or without a diaphragm or condom if you have sex with only one partner who is not infected with HIV and who has no other sexual partners or HIV risk factors”.
</P>
<P>(3) “[bullet] use a latex condom without nonoxynol 9 if you or your sex partner has HIV/AIDS, multiple sex partners, or other HIV risk factors”.

You may obtain a copy from the ISO Copyright Office, Case Postale 56, CH-1211, Geneva 20, Switzerland, telephone +41-22-749-01-11 or fax +41-22-74-09-47. <I>http://www.iso.org.</I> You may inspect a copy at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 22, Silver Spring, MD 20993, call 301-796-2090, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <I>http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.</I> The solar simulator output should be measured before and after each phototest or, at a minimum, at the beginning and end of each test day. This radiometer should be calibrated using side-by-side comparison with the spectroradiometer (using the weighting factors determined according to paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) of this section) at the time of the annual spectroradiometric measurement of the solar simulator as described in paragraph (i)(1)(iv) of this section.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Operation.</I> A solar simulator should have no significant time-related fluctuations (within 20 percent) in radiation emissions after an appropriate warm-up time and demonstrate good beam uniformity (within 20 percent) in the exposure plane. The delivered dose to the UV exposure site must be within 10 percent of the expected dose.
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>Periodic measurement.</I> To ensure that the solar simulator delivers the appropriate spectrum of UV radiation, the emission spectrum of the solar simulator should be measured at least annually with an appropriate and accurately calibrated spectroradiometer system (results should be traceable to the National Institute for Standards and Technology). In addition, the solar simulator must be recalibrated if there is any change in the lamp bulb or the optical filtering components (<I>i.e.,</I> filters, mirrors, lenses, collimating devices, or focusing devices). Daily solar simulator radiation intensity should be monitored with a broadband radiometer with a response weighted to match the erythema action spectrum in ISO 17166 CIE S 007/E entitled “Erythemal reference action spectrum and standard erythema dose,” which is incorporated by reference in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. If a lamp must be replaced due to failure or aging during a phototest, broadband device readings consistent with those obtained for the original calibrated lamp will suffice until measurements can be performed with the spectroradiometer at the earliest possible opportunity.

</P>
<img src="/graphics/er17jn11.004.gif"/>
<P>(<I>ii</I>) The percent of oxybenzone and padimate O in the SPF standard should be between 95 and 105.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Test subjects</I>—(i) <I>Number of subjects.</I> A test panel should include enough subjects to produce a minimum of 10 valid test results. A maximum of three subjects may be rejected from this panel based on paragraph (i)(5)(v)) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Medical history.</I> (A) Obtain a medical history from each subject with emphasis on the effects of sunlight on the subject's skin. Determine that each subject is in good general health with skin type I, II, or III as follows:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) Always burns easily; never tans (sensitive).
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) Always burns easily; tans minimally (sensitive).
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) Burns moderately; tans gradually (light brown) (normal).
</P>
<P>(<I>4</I>) Burns minimally; always tans well (moderate brown) (normal).
</P>
<P>(<I>5</I>) Rarely burns; tans profusely (dark brown) (insensitive).
</P>
<P>(<I>6</I>) Never burns; deeply pigmented (insensitive).
</P>
<P>(B) Skin type is based on first 30 to 45 minutes of sun exposure after a winter season of no sun exposure. Determine that each subject is not taking topical or systemic medication that is known to alter responses to UV radiation. Determine that each subject has no history of sensitivities to topical products and/or abnormal responses to sunlight, such as a phototoxic or photoallergic response.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Physical examination.</I> Conduct a physical examination to determine the presence of sunburn, suntan, scars, active dermal lesions, and uneven skin tones on the areas of the back to be tested. A suitable source of low power UVA, such as a Woods lamp, is helpful in this process. If any of these conditions are present, the subject is not qualified to participate in the study. The presence of nevi, blemishes, or moles will be acceptable if, in the physician's judgment, they will neither compromise the study nor jeopardize a subject's safety. Subjects with dysplastic nevi should not be enrolled. Excess hair on the back is acceptable if the hair is clipped. Shaving is unacceptable because it may remove a significant portion of the stratum corneum and temporarily alter the skin's response to UV radiation.
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>Informed consent.</I> Obtain legally effective written informed consent from all test subjects.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Sunscreen application.</I> (i) <I>Test site.</I> Test sites are locations on each subject's back, between the beltline and the shoulder blades (scapulae) and lateral to the midline, where skin responses to UV radiation are determined. Responses on unprotected skin (no test material applied) and protected skin (sunscreen test product(s) or SPF standard applied) are determined at separate unprotected and protected test sites, respectively. Test sites should be randomly located in a blinded manner. Each test site should be a minimum of 30 square centimeters and outlined with indelible ink.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Test subsite.</I> Test subsites are the locations to which UV radiation is administered within a test site. At least five test subsites should receive UV doses within each test site. Test subsites should be at least 0.5 square centimeters (cm
<SU>2</SU>) in area and should be separated from each other by at least 0.8 cm. Each test subsite should be outlined with indelible ink.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Applying test materials.</I> Apply the sunscreen test product and the SPF standard at 2 milligrams per square centimeter (mg/cm
<SU>2</SU>) to their respective test sites. Use a finger cot compatible with the sunscreen to spread the product as evenly as possible.
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>Waiting period.</I> Wait at least 15 minutes after applying a sunscreen product before exposing the test sites to UV radiation as described in paragraph (i)(5)) of this section. For water resistant sunscreen products, proceed with the water resistance testing procedure described in paragraph (i)(7) of this section after waiting at least 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>UV exposure</I>—(i) <I>Definition of minimal erythema dose (MED).</I> The minimal erythema dose (MED) is the smallest UV dose that produces perceptible redness of the skin (erythema) with clearly defined borders at 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure. The MED for unprotected skin (MED<E T="52">u</E>) is determined on a test site that does not have sunscreen applied. The MED for protected skin (MED<E T="52">p</E>) is determined on a test site that has sunscreen applied. An MED<E T="52">p</E> is determined for the SPF standard (ssMED<E T="52">p</E>). An MED<E T="52">p</E> is determined for the sunscreen test product (tpMED<E T="52">p</E>).
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>UV exposure for initial</I> MED<E T="52">u</E>. For each test subject, administer a series of UV radiation doses expressed as J/m
<SU>2</SU>-eff (as determined according to paragraph (a)(2) of this section) to the test subsites within an unprotected test site using an accurately calibrated solar simulator. Select doses that are a geometric series represented by 1.25
<SU>n</SU> (<I>i.e.,</I> each dose is 25 percent greater than the previous dose).
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>UV exposure for final</I> MED<E T="52">u</E>, ssMED<E T="52">p</E>, <I>and</I> tpMED<E T="52">p</E>. For each subject, determine the final MED<E T="52">u</E>, ssMED<E T="52">p</E>, and tpMED<E T="52">p</E> by administering a series of five UV doses to the appropriate test sites. The middle dose (X) in each of these dose series (<I>i.e.,</I> the third dose) should equal the initial MED<E T="52">u</E> times the expected SPF. Note that the expected SPF equals 1 and 16.3 for the final MED<E T="52">u</E> and ssMED<E T="52">p</E>, respectively. The remaining UV doses in the series depend upon the expected SPF value of the sunscreen test product(s).
</P>
<P>For products with an expected SPF less than 8, administer UV doses that increase by 25 percent with each successive dose (<I>i.e.,</I> 0.64X, 0.80X, 1.00X, 1.25X, and 1.56X). For products with an expected SPF from 8 to 15, administer UV doses that increase by 20 percent with each successive dose (<I>i.e.,</I> 0.69X, 0.83X, 1.00X, 1.20X, and 1.44X). For products with an expected SPF higher than 15, administer UV doses that increase by 15 percent with each successive dose (<I>i.e.,</I> 0.76X, 0.87X, 1.00X, 1.15X, and 1.32X).
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>Evaluation of test subsites.</I> In order that the person who evaluates the test subsites is not biased, he/she should not be the same person who applied the sunscreen drug product to the test site or administered the UV doses. After UV doses are administered, all immediate responses should be recorded. These may include an immediate darkening or tanning, typically grayish or purplish in color, which fades in 30 to 60 minutes; an immediate reddening at the subsite, due to heating of the skin, which fades rapidly; and an immediate generalized heat response, spreading beyond the subsite, which fades in 30 to 60 minutes. After the immediate responses are noted, each subject should shield the exposed area from further UV radiation until the MED is determined. Determine the MED 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure. Because erythema is evaluated 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure, the final MED<E T="52">u</E>, ssMED<E T="52">p</E>, and tpMED<E T="52">p</E> are typically determined the day following determination of the initial MED<E T="52">u</E>. Evaluate the erythema responses of each test subsite using either tungsten or warm white fluorescent lighting that provides at least 450 lux of illumination at the test site. For the evaluation, the test subject should be in the same position as when the test site was irradiated.
</P>
<P>(v) <I>Invalid test data.</I> Reject test data for a test subject if erythema is not present on either the unprotected or protected test sites; or erythema is present at all subsites; or the responses are inconsistent with the series of UV doses administered; or the subject was noncompliant (e.g., the subject withdraws from the test due to illness or work conflicts or does not shield the exposed testing sites from further UV radiation until the MED is determined).
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Determination of SPF.</I> (i) Calculate an SPF value for each test subject (SPF<E T="52">i</E>) as follows:
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er17jn11.005.gif"/>
<P>(ii) Calculate the mean 
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er17jn11.009.gif"/>
<FP>and the standard deviation (s) from the SPF<E T="52">i</E> values. Calculate the standard error (SE), which equals s/√n (where n equals the number of subjects who provided valid test results). Obtain the t value from Student's t distribution table corresponding to the upper 5-percent point with n—1 degrees of freedom. Determine the labeled SPF value, which equals the largest whole number less than 
</FP>
<img src="/graphics/er17jn11.012.gif"/>
<FP>In order for the SPF determination of a test product to be considered valid, the SPF value of the SPF standard should fall within the standard deviation range of the expected SPF (<I>i.e.,</I> 16.3 ±3.43).
</FP>
<P>(7) <I>Determination of water resistance.</I> The following procedure should be performed in an indoor fresh water pool, whirlpool, and/or hot tub maintained at 23 to 32 °C. Fresh water is clean drinking water that meets the standards in 40 CFR part 141. The pool and air temperature and the relative humidity should be recorded.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Water resistance (40 minutes).</I> The labeled SPF should be determined after 40 minutes of water immersion using the following procedure:
</P>
<P>(A) Step 1: Apply the sunscreen as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P>(B) Step 2: Perform moderate activity in water for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>(C) Step 3: Rest out of water for 15 minutes. Do not towel test site(s).
</P>
<P>(D) Step 4: Perform moderate activity in water for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>(E) Step 5: Allow test sites to dry completely without toweling.
</P>
<P>(F) Step 6: Apply the SPF standard as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P><I>Step 1.</I> Expose test sites to UV doses as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Water resistance (80 minutes).</I> The labeled SPF should be determined after 80 minutes of water immersion using the following procedure:
</P>
<P>(A) Step 1: Apply the sunscreen as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P>(B) Step 2: Perform moderate activity in water for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>(C) Step 3: Rest out of water for 15 minutes. Do not towel test site(s).
</P>
<P>(D) Step 4: Perform moderate activity in water for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>(E) Step 5: Rest out of water for 15 minutes. Do not towel test site(s).
</P>
<P>(F) Step 6: Perform moderate activity in water for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>(G) Step 7: Rest out of water for 15 minutes. Do not towel test site(s).
</P>
<P>(H) Step 8: Perform moderate activity in water for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>(I) Step 9: Allow test sites to dry completely without toweling.
</P>
<P>(J) Step 10: Apply the SPF standard as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P>(K) Step 11: Expose test sites to UV doses as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Broad spectrum test procedure</I>—(1) <I>UV Spectrometry.</I> (i) <I>Plate.</I> Use optical-grade polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) plates suitable for UV transmittance measurements. The plate should be roughened on one side to a three dimensional surface topography measure (Sa) between 2 and 7 micrometers and must have a rectangular application area of at least 16 square centimeters (with no side shorter than 4 cm).
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Sample holder.</I> The sample holder should hold the PMMA plate in a horizontal position to avoid flowing of the sunscreen drug product from one edge of the PMMA plate to the other. It should be mounted as close as possible to the input optics of the spectrometer to maximize capture of forward scattered radiation. The sample holder should be a thin, flat plate with a suitable aperture through which UV radiation can pass. The PMMA plate should be placed on the upper surface of the sample holder with the roughened side facing up.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Light source.</I> The light source should produce a continuous spectral distribution of UV radiation from 290 to 400 nanometers.
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>Input optics.</I> Unless the spectrometer is equipped with an integrating sphere, an ultraviolet radiation diffuser should be placed between the sample and the input optics of the spectrometer. The diffuser will be constructed from any UV radiation transparent material (e.g., Teflon ® or quartz). The diffuser ensures that the radiation received by the spectrometer is not collimated. The spectrometer input slits should be set to provide a bandwidth that is less than or equal to 1 nanometer.
</P>
<P>(v) <I>Dynamic range of the spectrometer.</I> The dynamic range of the spectrometer should be sufficient to measure transmittance accurately through a highly absorbing sunscreen product at all terrestrial solar UV wavelengths (290 to 400 nm).
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Sunscreen product application to PMMA plate.</I> The accuracy of the test depends upon the application of a precisely controlled amount of sunscreen product with a uniform distribution over the PMMA plate. The product is applied at 0.75 mg per square centimeter to the roughened side of the PMMA plate. The sunscreen product should be applied in a series of small dots over the entire PMMA plate and then spread evenly using a gloved finger. Spreading should be done with a very light spreading action for approximately 30 seconds followed by spreading with greater pressure for approximately 30 seconds. The plate should then be allowed to equilibrate for 15 minutes in the dark before the pre-irradiation described in paragraph (c) of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Sunscreen product pre-irradiation.</I> To account for lack of photostability, apply the sunscreen product to the PMMA plate as described in paragraph (b) of this section and then irradiate with a solar simulator described in section 352.70(b) of this chapter. The irradiation dose should be 4 MEDs which is equivalent to an erythemal effective dose of 800 J/m
<SU>2</SU> (<I>i.e.,</I> 800 J/m
<SU>2</SU>-eff).
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Calculation of mean transmittance values.</I> After pre-irradiation described in paragraph (c) of this section, mean transmittance values should be determined for each wavelength λ over the full UV spectrum (290 to 400 nanometers). The transmittance values should be measured at 1 nanometer intervals. Measurements of spectral irradiance transmitted for each wavelength λ through control PMMA plates coated with 15 microliters of glycerin (no sunscreen product) should be obtained from at least 5 different locations on the PMMA plate [C1(λ), C2(λ), C3(λ), C4(λ), and C5(λ)]. In addition, a minimum of 5 measurements of spectral irradiance transmitted for each wavelength λ through the PMMA plate covered with the sunscreen product will be similarly obtained after pre-irradiation of the sunscreen product [P1(λ), P2(λ), P3(λ), P4(λ), and P5(λ)]. 
</P>
<P>The mean transmittance for each wavelength, 
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er17jn11.010.gif"/>
<FP>is the ratio of the mean of the C(λ) values to the mean of the P(λ) values, as follows:
</FP>
<img src="/graphics/er17jn11.006.gif"/>
<EXTRACT>
<FP-2>Where n ≥5</FP-2></EXTRACT>
<P>(5) <I>Calculation of mean absorbance values.</I> (i) Mean transmittance values, 
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er17jn11.010.gif"/>
<FP>are converted into mean absorbance values, 
</FP>
<img src="/graphics/er17jn11.011.gif"/>
<FP>at each wavelength by taking the negative logarithm of the mean transmittance value as follows:
</FP>
<img src="/graphics/er17jn11.008.gif"/>
<P>(ii) The calculation yields 111 monochromatic absorbance values in 1 nanometer increments from 290 to 400 nanometers.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Number of plates.</I> For each sunscreen product, mean absorbance values should be determined from at least three individual PMMA plates. Because paragraph (d) of this section requires at least 5 measurements per plate, there should be a total of at least 15 measurements.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Calculation of the critical wavelength.</I> The critical wavelength is identified as the wavelength at which the integral of the spectral absorbance curve reaches 90 percent of the integral over the UV spectrum from 290 to 400 nm. The following equation defines the critical wavelength:
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er17jn11.007.gif"/>
<EXTRACT>
<FP-2>Where λc = critical wavelength
</FP-2>
<FP-2>A(λ) = mean absorbance at each wavelength
</FP-2>
<FP-2>dλ = wavelength interval between measurements</FP-2></EXTRACT>
<FP>A mean critical wavelength of 370 nm or greater is classified as broad spectrum protection.

<HEAD>§ 202.1   Prescription-drug advertisements.</HEAD>
<P><I>Prescription drug</I> as used in this section means any drug defined in section 503(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or § 201.105 of this chapter, applicable to drugs intended for use by humans and to veterinary drugs, respectively.


</P>
<P>(a)(1) The ingredient information required by section 502(n) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act shall appear together, without any intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, except the proprietary names of ingredients, which may be included with the listing of established names.
</P>
<P>(2) The order of listing of ingredients in the advertisement shall be the same as the order of listing of ingredients on the label of the product, and the information presented in the advertisement concerning the quantity of each such ingredient shall be the same as the corresponding information on the label of the product.
</P>
<P>(3) The advertisement shall not employ a fanciful proprietary name for the drug or any ingredient in such a manner as to imply that the drug or ingredient has some unique effectiveness or composition, when, in fact, the drug or ingredient is a common substance, the limitations of which are readily recognized when the drug or ingredient is listed by its established name.
</P>
<P>(4) The advertisement shall not feature inert or inactive ingredients in a manner that creates an impression of value greater than their true functional role in the formulation.
</P>
<P>(5) The advertisement shall not designate a drug or ingredient by a proprietary name that, because of similarity in spelling or pronunciation, may be confused with the proprietary name or the established name of a different drug or ingredient.
</P>
<P>(b)(1) If an advertisement for a prescription drug bears a proprietary name or designation for the drug or any ingredient thereof, the established name, if such there be, corresponding to such proprietary name or designation shall accompany such proprietary name or designation each time it is featured in the advertisement for the drug; but, except as provided below in this subparagraph, the established name need not be used with the proprietary name or designation in the running text of the advertisement. On any page of an advertisement in which the proprietary name or designation is not featured but is used in the running text, the established name shall be used at least once in the running text in association with such proprietary name or designation and in the same type size used in the running text: <I>Provided, however,</I> That if the proprietary name or designation is used in the running text in larger size type, the established name shall be used at least once in association with, and in type at least half as large as the type used for, the most prominent presentation of the proprietary name or designation in such running text. If any advertisement includes a column with running text containing detailed information as to composition, prescribing, side effects, or contraindications and the proprietary name or designation is used in such column but is not featured above or below the column, the established name shall be used at least once in such column of running text in association with such proprietary name or designation and in the same type size used in such column of running text: <I>Provided, however,</I> That if the proprietary name or designation is used in such column of running text in larger size type, the established name shall be used at least once in association with, and in type at least half as large as the type used for, the most prominent presentation of the proprietary name or designation in such column of running text. Where the established name is required to accompany or to be used in association with the proprietary name or designation, the established name shall be placed in direct conjunction with the proprietary name or designation, and the relationship between the proprietary name or designation and the established name shall be made clear by use of a phrase such as “brand of” preceding the established name, by brackets surrounding the established name, or by other suitable means.
</P>
<P>(2) The established name shall be printed in letters that are at least half as large as the letters comprising the proprietary name or designation with which it is joined, and the established name shall have a prominence commensurate with the prominence with which such proprietary name or designation appears, taking into account all pertinent factors, including typography, layout, contrast, and other printing features.
</P>
<P>(c) In the case of a prescription drug containing two or more active ingredients, if the advertisement bears a proprietary name or designation for such mixture and there is no established name corresponding to such proprietary name or designation, the quantitative ingredient information required in the advertisement by section 502(n) of the act shall be placed in direct conjunction with the most prominent display of the proprietary name or designation. The prominence of the quantitative ingredient information shall bear a reasonable relationship to the prominence of the proprietary name.
</P>
<P>(d)(1) If the advertisement employs one proprietary name or designation to refer to a combination of active ingredients present in more than one preparation (the individual preparations differing from each other as to quantities of active ingredients and/or the form of the finished preparation) and there is no established name corresponding to such proprietary name or designation, a listing showing the established names of the active ingredients shall be placed in direct conjunction with the most prominent display of such proprietary name or designation. The prominence of this listing of active ingredients shall bear a reasonable relationship to the prominence of the proprietary name and the relationship between such proprietary name or designation, and the listing of active ingredients shall be made clear by use of such phrase as “brand of”, preceding the listing of active ingredients.
</P>
<P>(2) The advertisement shall prominently display the name of at least one specific dosage form and shall have the quantitative ingredient information required by section 502(n) of the act in direct conjunction with such display. If other dosage forms are listed in the advertisement, the quantitative ingredient information for such dosage forms shall appear in direct conjunction and in equal prominence with the most prominent listing of the names of such dosage forms.


</P>
<P>(e) True statement of information in brief summary relating to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>When required.</I> All advertisements for any prescription drug, except advertisements described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, must present a true statement of information in brief summary relating to side effects, contraindications (when used in this section, “side effects, contraindications” include side effects, warnings, precautions, and contraindications and include any such information under such headings as cautions, special considerations, important notes, etc.), and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Broadcast advertisements.</I> Advertisements broadcast through media such as radio, television, or telephone communications systems must:
</P>
<P>(A) Include information relating to the major side effects and contraindications (“major statement”) of the advertised drugs in the audio or audio and visual parts of the presentation, unless required by paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C) of this section to present the major statement using audio and text; and
</P>
<P>(B) Contain a brief summary of all necessary information related to side effects and contraindications, unless adequate provision is made for dissemination of the approved or permitted product labeling in connection with the broadcast presentation.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Human drug advertisements in television or radio format</I>—<I>Clear, conspicuous, and neutral manner.</I> For advertisements for prescription drugs intended for use by humans presented directly to consumers in television or radio format, the major statement must be presented in a clear, conspicuous, and neutral manner. The major statement is presented in a clear, conspicuous, and neutral manner if the following are met:
</P>
<P>(A) It is presented in consumer-friendly language and terminology that is readily understandable.
</P>
<P>(B) Its audio information, in terms of the volume, articulation, and pacing used, is at least as understandable as the audio information presented in the rest of the advertisement.
</P>
<P>(C) In advertisements in television format, it is presented concurrently using both audio and text (dual modality). To achieve dual modality:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) Either the text displays the verbatim key terms or phrases from the corresponding audio, or the text displays the verbatim complete transcript of the corresponding audio; and
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) The text is displayed for a sufficient duration to allow it to be read easily. For purposes of the standard in this paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C)(<I>2</I>), the duration is considered sufficient if the text display begins at the same time and ends at approximately the same time as the corresponding audio.
</P>
<P>(D) In advertisements in television format, for the text portion of the major statement, the size and style of font, the contrast with the background, and the placement on the screen allow the information to be read easily.
</P>
<P>(E) During the presentation of the major statement, the advertisement does not include audio or visual elements, alone or in combination, that are likely to interfere with comprehension of the major statement.








</P>
<P>(2) <I>Exempt advertisements.</I> The following advertisements are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section under the conditions specified:
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Reminder advertisements.</I> Reminder advertisements are those which call attention to the name of the drug product but do not include indications or dosage recommendations for use of the drug product. These reminder advertisements shall contain only the proprietary name of the drug product, if any; the established name of the drug product, if any; the established name of each active ingredient in the drug product; and, optionally, information relating to quantitative ingredient statements, dosage form, quantity of package contents, price, the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor or other written, printed, or graphic matter containing no representation or suggestion relating to the advertised drug product. If the Commissioner finds that there is evidence of significant incidence of fatalities or serious injury associated with the use of a particular prescription drug, he may withdraw this exemption by so notifying the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the drug by letter. Reminder advertisements, other than those solely intended to convey price information including, but not limited to, those subject to the requirements of § 200.200 of this chapter, are not permitted for a prescription drug product whose labeling contains a boxed warning relating to a serious hazard associated with the use of the drug product. Reminder advertisements which are intended to provide consumers with information concerning the price charged for a prescription for a drug product are exempt from the requirements of this section if they meet all of the conditions contained in § 200.200 of this chapter. Reminder advertisements, other than those subject to the requirements of § 200.200 of this chapter, are not permitted for a drug for which an announcement has been published pursuant to a review on the labeling claims for the drug by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group, and for which no claim has been evaluated as higher than “possibly effective.” If the Commissioner finds the circumstances are such that a reminder advertisement may be misleading to prescribers of drugs subject to NAS/NRC evaluation, such advertisements will not be allowed and the manufacturer, packer, or distributor will be notified either in the publication of the conclusions on the effectiveness of the drug or by letter.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Advertisements of bulk-sale drugs.</I> Advertisements of bulk-sale drugs that promote sale of the drug in bulk packages in accordance with the practice of the trade solely to be processed, manufactured, labeled, or repackaged in substantial quantities and that contain no claims for the therapeutic safety or effectiveness of the drug.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Advertisements of prescription-compounding drugs.</I> Advertisements of prescription-compounding drugs that promote sale of a drug for use as a prescription chemical or other compound for use by registered pharmacists in compounding prescriptions if the drug otherwise complies with the conditions for the labeling exemption contained in § 201.120 and the advertisement contains no claims for the therapeutic safety or effectiveness of the drug.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Scope of information to be included; applicability to the entire advertisement.</I> (i) The requirement of a true statement of information relating to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness applies to the entire advertisement. Untrue or misleading information in any part of the advertisement will not be corrected by the inclusion in another distinct part of the advertisement of a brief statement containing true information relating to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness of the drug. If any part or theme of the advertisement would make the advertisement false or misleading by reason of the omission of appropriate qualification or pertinent information, that part or theme shall include the appropriate qualification or pertinent information, which may be concise if it is supplemented by a prominent reference on each page to the presence and location elsewhere in the advertisement of a more complete discussion of such qualification or information.
</P>
<P>(ii) The information relating to effectiveness is not required to include information relating to all purposes for which the drug is intended but may optionally be limited to a true statement of the effectiveness of the drug for the selected purpose(s) for which the drug is recommended or suggested in the advertisement. The information relating to effectiveness shall include specific indications for use of the drug for purposes claimed in the advertisement; for example, when an advertisement contains a broad claim that a drug is an antibacterial agent, the advertisement shall name a type or types of infections and microorganisms for which the drug is effective clinically as specifically as required, approved, or permitted in the drug package labeling.
</P>
<P>(iii) The information relating to side effects and contraindications shall disclose each specific side effect and contraindication (which include side effects, warnings, precautions, and contraindications and include any such information under such headings as cautions, special considerations, important notes, etc.; see paragraph (e)(1) of this section) contained in required, approved, or permitted labeling for the advertised drug dosage form(s): <I>Provided, however,</I>
</P>
<P>(<I>a</I>) The side effects and contraindications disclosed may be limited to those pertinent to the indications for which the drug is recommended or suggested in the advertisement to the extent that such limited disclosure has previously been approved or permitted in drug labeling conforming to the provisions of §§ 201.100 or 201.105; and
</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) The use of a single term for a group of side effects and contraindications (for example, “blood dyscrasias” for disclosure of “leukopenia,” “agranulocytosis,” and “neutropenia”) is permitted only to the extent that the use of such a single term in place of disclosure of each specific side effect and contraindication has been previously approved or permitted in drug labeling conforming to the provisions of §§ 201.100 or 201.105.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Substance of information to be included in brief summary.</I> (i)(<I>a</I>) An advertisement for a prescription drug covered by a new-drug application approved pursuant to section 505 of the act after October 10, 1962, or a prescription drug covered by a new animal drug application approved pursuant to section 512 of the act after August 1, 1969, or any approved supplement thereto, or for a prescription drug listed in the index pursuant to section 572 of the act, or any granted modification thereto, shall not recommend or suggest any use that is not in the labeling accepted in such approved new-drug application or supplement, new animal drug application or supplement, or new animal drug index listing or modification. The advertisement shall present information from labeling required, approved, permitted, or granted in a new-drug or new animal drug application or new animal drug index listing relating to each specific side effect and contraindication in such labeling that relates to the uses of the advertised drug dosage form(s) or shall otherwise conform to the provisions of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) If a prescription drug was covered by a new-drug application or a supplement thereto that became effective prior to October 10, 1962, an advertisement may recommend or suggest:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) Uses contained in the labeling accepted in such new-drug application and any effective, approved, or permitted supplement thereto.
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) Additional uses contained in labeling in commercial use on October 9, 1962, to the extent that such uses did not cause the drug to be an unapproved “new drug” as “new drug” was defined in section 201(p) of the act as then in force, and to the extent that such uses would be permitted were the drug subject to paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section.
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) Additional uses contained in labeling in current commercial use to the extent that such uses do not cause the drug to be an unapproved “new drug” as defined in section 201(p) of the act as amended or a “new animal drug” as defined in section 201(v) of the act as amended.
</P>
<FP>The advertisement shall present information from labeling required, approved, or permitted in a new-drug application relating to each specific side effect and contraindication in such labeling that relates to the uses of the advertised drug dosage form(s) or shall otherwise conform to the provisions of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
</FP>
<P>(ii) In the case of an advertisement for a prescription drug other than a drug the labeling of which causes it to be an unapproved “new drug” and other than drugs covered by paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, an advertisement may recommend and suggest the drug only for those uses contained in the labeling thereof:
</P>
<P>(<I>a</I>) For which the drug is generally recognized as safe and effective among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of such drugs; or
</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) For which there exists substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness, consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations (as used in this section “clinical investigations,” “clinical experience,” and “clinical significance” mean in the case of drugs intended for administration to man, investigations, experience, or significance in humans, and in the case of drugs intended for administration to other animals, investigations, experience, or significance in the specie or species for which the drug is advertised), by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the drug involved, on the basis of which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that the drug is safe and effective for such uses; or
</P>
<P>(<I>c</I>) For which there exists substantial clinical experience (as used in this section this means substantial clinical experience adequately documented in medical literature or by other data (to be supplied to the Food and Drug Administration, if requested)), on the basis of which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that the drug is safe and effective for such uses; or
</P>
<P>(<I>d</I>) For which safety is supported under any of the preceding clauses in paragraphs (e)(4)(iii) (<I>a</I>), (<I>b</I>), and (<I>c</I>) of this section and effectiveness is supported under any other of such clauses.
</P>
<FP>The advertisement shall present information relating to each specific side effect and contraindication that is required, approved, or permitted in the package labeling by §§ 201.100 or 201.105 of this chapter of the drug dosage form(s) or shall otherwise conform to the provisions of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
</FP>
<P>(5) <I>“True statement” of information.</I> An advertisement does not satisfy the requirement that it present a “true statement” of information in brief summary relating to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness if:
</P>
<P>(i) It is false or misleading with respect to side effects, contraindications, or effectiveness; or
</P>
<P>(ii) It fails to present a fair balance between information relating to side effects and contraindications and information relating to effectiveness of the drug in that the information relating to effectiveness is presented in greater scope, depth, or detail than is required by section 502(n) of the act and this information is not fairly balanced by a presentation of a summary of true information relating to side effects and contraindications of the drug; <I>Provided, however,</I> That no advertisement shall be considered to be in violation of this section if the presentation of true information relating to side effects and contraindications is comparable in depth and detail with the claims for effectiveness or safety.
</P>
<P>(iii) It fails to reveal facts material in the light of its representations or material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the advertisement.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Advertisements that are false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading.</I> An advertisement for a prescription drug is false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading, or otherwise violative of section 502(n) of the act, among other reasons, if it:
</P>
<P>(i) Contains a representation or suggestion, not approved or permitted for use in the labeling, that a drug is better, more effective, useful in a broader range of conditions or patients (as used in this section <I>patients</I> means humans and in the case of veterinary drugs, other animals), safer, has fewer, or less incidence of, or less serious side effects or contraindications than has been demonstrated by substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience (as described in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii) (<I>b</I>) and (<I>c</I>) of this section) whether or not such representations are made by comparison with other drugs or treatments, and whether or not such a representation or suggestion is made directly or through use of published or unpublished literature, quotations, or other references.
</P>
<P>(ii) Contains a drug comparison that represents or suggests that a drug is safer or more effective than another drug in some particular when it has not been demonstrated to be safer or more effective in such particular by substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience.
</P>
<P>(iii) Contains favorable information or opinions about a drug previously regarded as valid but which have been rendered invalid by contrary and more credible recent information, or contains literature references or quotations that are significantly more favorable to the drug than has been demonstrated by substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience.
</P>
<P>(iv) Contains a representation or suggestion that a drug is safer than it has been demonstrated to be by substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience, by selective presentation of information from published articles or other references that report no side effects or minimal side effects with the drug or otherwise selects information from any source in a way that makes a drug appear to be safer than has been demonstrated.
</P>
<P>(v) Presents information from a study in a way that implies that the study represents larger or more general experience with the drug than it actually does.
</P>
<P>(vi) Contains references to literature or studies that misrepresent the effectiveness of a drug by failure to disclose that claimed results may be due to concomitant therapy, or by failure to disclose the credible information available concerning the extent to which claimed results may be due to placebo effect (information concerning placebo effect is not required unless the advertisement promotes the drug for use by man).
</P>
<P>(vii) Contains favorable data or conclusions from nonclinical studies of a drug, such as in laboratory animals or in vitro, in a way that suggests they have clinical significance when in fact no such clinical significance has been demonstrated.
</P>
<P>(viii) Uses a statement by a recognized authority that is apparently favorable about a drug but fails to refer to concurrent or more recent unfavorable data or statements from the same authority on the same subject or subjects.
</P>
<P>(ix) Uses a quote or paraphrase out of context to convey a false or misleading idea.
</P>
<P>(x) Uses literature, quotations, or references that purport to support an advertising claim but in fact do not support the claim or have relevance to the claim.
</P>
<P>(xi) Uses literature, quotations, or references for the purpose of recommending or suggesting conditions of drug use that are not approved or permitted in the drug package labeling.
</P>
<P>(xii) Offers a combination of drugs for the treatment of patients suffering from a condition amenable to treatment by any of the components rather than limiting the indications for use to patients for whom concomitant therapy as provided by the fixed combination drug is indicated, unless such condition is included in the uses permitted under paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
</P>
<P>(xiii) Uses a study on normal individuals without disclosing that the subjects were normal, unless the drug is intended for use on normal individuals.
</P>
<P>(xiv) Uses “statistics” on numbers of patients, or counts of favorable results or side effects, derived from pooling data from various insignificant or dissimilar studies in a way that suggests either that such “statistics” are valid if they are not or that they are derived from large or significant studies supporting favorable conclusions when such is not the case.
</P>
<P>(xv) Uses erroneously a statistical finding of “no significant difference” to claim clinical equivalence or to deny or conceal the potential existence of a real clinical difference.
</P>
<P>(xvi) Uses statements or representations that a drug differs from or does not contain a named drug or category of drugs, or that it has a greater potency per unit of weight, in a way that suggests falsely or misleadingly or without substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience that the advertised drug is safer or more effective than such other drug or drugs.
</P>
<P>(xvii) Uses data favorable to a drug derived from patients treated with dosages different from those recommended in approved or permitted labeling if the drug advertised is subject to section 505 of the act, or, in the case of other drugs, if the dosages employed were different from those recommended in the labeling and generally recognized as safe and effective. This provision is not intended to prevent citation of reports of studies that include some patients treated with dosages different from those authorized, if the results in such patients are not used.
</P>
<P>(xviii) Uses headline, subheadline, or pictorial or other graphic matter in a way that is misleading.
</P>
<P>(xix) Represents or suggests that drug dosages properly recommended for use in the treatment of certain classes of patients or disease conditions are safe and effective for the treatment of other classes of patients or disease conditions when such is not the case.
</P>
<P>(xx) Presents required information relating to side effects or contraindications by means of a general term for a group in place of disclosing each specific side effect and contraindication (for example employs the term <I>blood dyscrasias</I> instead of “leukopenia,” “agranulocytosis,” “neutropenia,” etc.) unless the use of such general term conforms to the provisions of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
</P>
<FP><I>Provided, however,</I> That any provision of this paragraph shall be waived with respect to a specified advertisement as set forth in a written communication from the Food and Drug Administration on a petition for such a waiver from a person who would be adversely affected by the enforcement of such provision on the basis of a showing that the advertisement is not false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading, or otherwise violative of section 502(n) of the act. A petition for such a waiver shall set forth clearly and concisely the petitioner's interest in the advertisement, the specific provision of this paragraph from which a waiver is sought, a complete copy of the advertisement, and a showing that the advertisement is not false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading, or otherwise violative of section 502(n) of the act.
</FP>
<P>(7) <I>Advertisements that may be false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading.</I> An advertisement may be false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading or otherwise violative of section 502(n) of the act if it:
</P>
<P>(i) Contains favorable information or conclusions from a study that is inadequate in design, scope, or conduct to furnish significant support for such information or conclusions.
</P>
<P>(ii) Uses the concept of “statistical significance” to support a claim that has not been demonstrated to have clinical significance or validity, or fails to reveal the range of variations around the quoted average results.
</P>
<P>(iii) Uses statistical analyses and techniques on a retrospective basis to discover and cite findings not soundly supported by the study, or to suggest scientific validity and rigor for data from studies the design or protocol of which are not amenable to formal statistical evaluations.
</P>
<P>(iv) Uses tables or graphs to distort or misrepresent the relationships, trends, differences, or changes among the variables or products studied; for example, by failing to label abscissa and ordinate so that the graph creates a misleading impression.
</P>
<P>(v) Uses reports or statements represented to be statistical analyses, interpretations, or evaluations that are inconsistent with or violate the established principles of statistical theory, methodology, applied practice, and inference, or that are derived from clinical studies the design, data, or conduct of which substantially invalidate the application of statistical analyses, interpretations, or evaluations.
</P>
<P>(vi) Contains claims concerning the mechanism or site of drug action that are not generally regarded as established by scientific evidence by experts qualified by scientific training and experience without disclosing that the claims are not established and the limitations of the supporting evidence.
</P>
<P>(vii) Fails to provide sufficient emphasis for the information relating to side effects and contraindications, when such information is contained in a distinct part of an advertisement, because of repetition or other emphasis in that part of the advertisement of claims for effectiveness or safety of the drug.
</P>
<P>(viii) Fails to present information relating to side effects and contraindications with a prominence and readability reasonably comparable with the presentation of information relating to effectiveness of the drug, taking into account all implementing factors such as typography, layout, contrast, headlines, paragraphing, white space, and any other techniques apt to achieve emphasis.
</P>
<P>(ix) Fails to provide adequate emphasis (for example, by the use of color scheme, borders, headlines, or copy that extends across the gutter) for the fact that two facing pages are part of the same advertisement when one page contains information relating to side effects and contraindications.
</P>
<P>(x) In an advertisement promoting use of the drug in a selected class of patients (for example, geriatric patients or depressed patients), fails to present with adequate emphasis the significant side effects and contraindications or the significant dosage considerations, when dosage recommendations are included in an advertisement, especially applicable to that selected class of patients.
</P>
<P>(xi) Fails to present on a page facing another page (or on another full page) of an advertisement on more than one page, information relating to side effects and contraindications when such information is in a distinct part of the advertisement.
</P>
<P>(xii) Fails to include on each page or spread of an advertisement the information relating to side effects and contraindications or a prominent reference to its presence and location when it is presented as a distinct part of an advertisement.
</P>
<P>(xiii) Contains information from published or unpublished reports or opinions falsely or misleadingly represented or suggested to be authentic or authoritative.
</P>
<P>(f)-(i) [Reserved]
</P>
<P>(j)(1) No advertisement concerning a particular prescription drug may be disseminated without prior approval by the Food and Drug Administration if:
</P>
<P>(i) The sponsor or the Food and Drug Administration has received information that has not been widely publicized in medical literature that the use of the drug may cause fatalities or serious damage;
</P>
<P>(ii) The Commissioner (or in his absence the officer acting as Commissioner), after evaluating the reliability of such information, has notified the sponsor that the information must be a part of the advertisements for the drug; and
</P>
<P>(iii) The sponsor has failed within a reasonable time as specified in such notification to present to the Food and Drug Administration a program, adequate in light of the nature of the information, for assuring that such information will be publicized promptly and adequately to the medical profession in subsequent advertisements.
</P>
<FP>If the Commissioner finds that the program presented is not being followed, he will notify the sponsor that prior approval of all advertisements for the particular drug will be required. Nothing in this paragraph is to be construed as limiting the Commissioner's or the Secretary's rights, as authorized by law, to issue publicity, to suspend any new-drug application, to decertify any antibiotic, or to recommend any regulatory action.
</FP>
<P>(2) Within a reasonable time after information concerning the possibility that a drug may cause fatalities or serious damage has been widely publicized in medical literature, the Food and Drug Administration shall notify the sponsor of the drug by mail that prior approval of advertisements for the drug is no longer necessary.
</P>
<P>(3) Dissemination of an advertisement not in compliance with this paragraph shall be deemed to be an act that causes the drug to be misbranded under section 502(n) of the act.

</P>
<P>(5) Be free from infestation by insects, rodents, birds, or vermin of any kind.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Security.</I> (1) All facilities used for wholesale drug distribution shall be secure from unauthorized entry.
</P>
<P>(i) Access from outside the premises shall be kept to a minimum and be well-controlled.
</P>
<P>(ii) The outside perimeter of the premises shall be well-lighted.

</P>
<P>(1) If no storage requirements are established for a prescription drug, the drug may be held at “controlled” room temperature, as defined in an official compendium, to help ensure that its identity, strength, quality, and purity are not adversely affected.
</P>
<P>(2) Appropriate manual, electromechanical, or electronic temperature and humidity recording equipment, devices, and/or logs shall be utilized to document proper storage of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>(3) The recordkeeping requirements in paragraph (f) of this section shall be followed for all stored drugs.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Examination of materials.</I> (1) Upon receipt, each outside shipping container shall be visually examined for identity and to prevent the acceptance of contaminated prescription drugs or prescription drugs that are otherwise unfit for distribution. This examination shall be adequate to reveal container damage that would suggest possible contamination or other damage to the contents.

</P>
<P>(e) <I>Returned, damaged, and outdated prescription drugs.</I> (1) Prescription drugs that are outdated, damaged, deteriorated, misbranded, or adulterated shall be quarantined and physically separated from other prescription drugs until they are destroyed or returned to their supplier.

</P>
<P>(3) If the conditions under which a prescription drug has been returned cast doubt on the drug's safety, identity, strength, quality, or purity, then the drug shall be destroyed, or returned to the supplier, unless examination, testing, or other investigation proves that the drug meets appropriate standards of safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity. In determining whether the conditions under which a drug has been returned cast doubt on the drug's safety, identity, strength, quality, or purity, the wholesale drug distributor shall consider, among other things, the conditions under which the drug has been held, stored, or shipped before or during its return and the condition of the drug and its container, carton, or labeling, as a result of storage or shipping.

<P>(3) Records described in this section that are kept at the inspection site or that can be immediately retrieved by computer or other electronic means shall be readily available for authorized inspection during the retention period. Records kept at a central location apart from the inspection site and not electronically retrievable shall be made available for inspection within 2 working days of a request by an authorized official of a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Written policies and procedures.</I> Wholesale drug distributors shall establish, maintain, and adhere to written policies and procedures, which shall be followed for the receipt, security, storage, inventory, and distribution of prescription drugs, including policies and procedures for identifying, recording, and reporting losses or thefts, and for correcting all errors and inaccuracies in inventories. Wholesale drug distributors shall include in their written policies and procedures the following:
</P>
<P>(1) A procedure whereby the oldest approved stock of a prescription drug product is distributed first. The procedure may permit deviation from this requirement, if such deviation is temporary and appropriate.
</P>
<P>(2) A procedure to be followed for handling recalls and withdrawals of prescription drugs. Such procedure shall be adequate to deal with recalls and withdrawals due to:

</P>
<P>(h) <I>Responsible persons.</I> Wholesale drug distributors shall establish and maintain lists of officers, directors, managers, and other persons in charge of wholesale drug distribution, storage, and handling, including a description of their duties and a summary of their qualifications.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Compliance with Federal, State, and local law.</I> Wholesale drug distributors shall operate in compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.

</P>
<P>(4) Radiopharmaceutical drug products.
</P>
<P>(b) Exemption of drugs because of size or unique physical characteristics:
</P>
<P>(1) For a drug subject to premarket approval, FDA may provide an exemption from the requirements of § 206.10 upon a showing that the product's size, shape, texture, or other physical characteristics make imprinting technologically infeasible or impossible.
</P>
<P>(i) Exemption requests for products with approved applications shall be made in writing to the appropriate review division in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Food and Drug Administration, 5901-B Ammendale Rd., Beltsville, MD 20705-1266 or the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Document Control Center, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Rm.

</P>
<P>(2) Any product not subject to premarket approval is exempt from the requirement of § 206.10 if, based on the product's size, shape, texture, or other physical characteristics, the manufacturer or distributor of the product is prepared to demonstrate that imprinting the dosage form is technologically infeasible or impossible.

<P>(a) Unless exempted under § 206.7, no drug product in solid oral dosage form may be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless it is clearly marked or imprinted with a code imprint that, in conjunction with the product's size, shape, and color, permits the unique identification of the drug product and the manufacturer or distributor of the product. Identification of the drug product requires identification of its active ingredients and its dosage strength. Inclusion of a letter or number in the imprint, while not required, is encouraged as a more effective means of identification than a symbol or logo by itself. Homeopathic drug products are required only to bear an imprint that identifies the manufacturer and their homeopathic nature.

</P>
<P><I>Foreign</I> for the purposes of registration and listing under this part:
</P>
<P>(1) When used to modify the term “manufacturer,” “repacker,” “relabeler,” or “salvager,” refers to a manufacturer, repacker, relabeler, or salvager, who is located in a foreign country and who manufactures, repacks, relabels, or salvages a drug, or an animal feed bearing or containing a new animal drug, that is imported or offered for import into the United States.
</P>

<P>(a) <I>What is the NDC for a drug and what products must have unique NDCs</I>? The NDC for a drug is a numeric code. Each finished drug product or unfinished drug subject to the listing requirements of this part must have a unique NDC to identify its labeler, product, and package size and type.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>What is the format of an NDC</I>? (1) Except as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the NDC must consist of 10 or 11 digits, divided into three segments as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) The first segment of the NDC is the labeler code and consists of 4, 5, or 6 digits. The labeler code is assigned by FDA.
</P>
<P>(ii) The second segment of the NDC is the product code and consists of 3 or 4 digits, as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section.
</P>
<P>(iii) The third segment of the NDC is the package code and consists of 1 or 2 digits as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section. The package code identifies the package size and type of the drug and differentiates between different quantitative and qualitative attributes of the product packaging.
</P>
<P>(2) The following combinations of labeler code, product code and package code character lengths are permissible:
</P>
<P>(i) If a labeler code is either 5 or 6 digits in length, it may be combined with:
</P>
<P>(A) A product code consisting of 4 digits and a package code consisting of 1 digit for a total NDC length of 10 or 11 digits (5-4-1 or 6-4-1), or
</P>
<P>(B) A product code consisting of 3 digits and a package code consisting of 2 digits for a total NDC length of 10 or 11 digits (5-3-2 or 6-3-2).
</P>
<P>(ii) If a labeler code is 4 digits in length, it may be combined only with a product code consisting of 4 digits and a package code consisting of 2 digits for a total NDC length of 10 digits (4-4-2).
</P>
<P>(3) A registrant or private label distributor with a given labeler code must use only one Product-Package Code configuration (e.g., a 3-digit product code combined with a 2-digit package code or a 4-digit product code combined with a 1-digit package code). This single configuration must be used in all NDCs that include the given labeler code that are reserved in accordance with § 207.33(d)(3) or listed in accordance with § 207.49 or § 207.53.
</P>
<P>(4) An alternatively formatted NDC that is approved for use by the relevant Center Director may be used for the following HCT/Ps if they are minimally manipulated: Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells derived from peripheral and cord blood, and lymphocytes collected from peripheral blood.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Who must obtain an NDC labeler code and how is the code assigned and updated</I>? (1) Each person who engages in manufacturing, repacking, relabeling, or private label distribution of a drug subject to listing under this part must apply for an NDC labeler code, by providing the following information:
</P>
<P>(i) The name, physical address, email address, and other contact information FDA may request, of the person for whom the NDC labeler code is requested;
</P>
<P>(ii) The type(s) of activities (e.g., manufacture or repacking) in which the person requesting the NDC labeler code engages with respect to human drugs; and
</P>
<P>(iii) The type(s) of drug(s) (human, animal, or both, and prescription, nonprescription, or both) to which the NDC labeler code will be applied.
</P>
<P>(2) Each person who is assigned an NDC labeler code must update the information submitted under paragraph (c)(1)of this section within 30 calendar days after any change to that information.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>How is an NDC proposed for assignment by FDA, when is an NDC assigned by FDA, and how can a proposed NDC be reserved</I>? (1) An NDC is proposed for assignment by FDA when it is submitted for the first time with listing information in accordance with § 207.49 or § 207.53, as applicable.
</P>
<P>(i) Each manufacturer, repacker, or relabeler must propose for assignment by FDA an NDC that includes its own labeler code for each package size and type of drug that it manufactures, repacks, or relabels for commercial distribution.
</P>
<P>(ii) In addition, if a drug is distributed under the trade name or label of a private label distributor, the manufacturer, repacker, or relabeler must also propose for assignment by FDA an NDC that includes the labeler code of the private label distributor under whose trade name or label the drug is distributed, for each package size and type so distributed.
</P>
<P>(2) If a proposed NDC conforms to the requirements of this section and is not reserved for a different drug or was not previously assigned to a different drug, FDA will assign the NDC to a drug when it receives listing information required for that drug under § 207.49 or § 207.53.
</P>
<P>(3) A manufacturer, repacker, relabeler, or private label distributor may voluntarily reserve a proposed NDC for a drug, before the drug is listed, by submitting the following information:
</P>
<P>(i) A proposed NDC that conforms to the requirements of this section;
</P>
<P>(ii) The established name of the active ingredient(s) and the strength of each active ingredient in the drug; and
</P>
<P>(iii) In the case of a finished drug product, the dosage form, and route of administration.
</P>
<P>(4) If the required information is submitted and the proposed NDC is properly formatted and not already assigned or reserved, FDA will reserve the proposed NDC for a period of 2 years from the date of submission. If the drug for which the proposed NDC is reserved is not listed in accordance with § 207.49 or § 207.53 during such 2-year period, the reservation of the proposed NDC will lapse. FDA may also cancel the reservation of a proposed NDC at any time on the request of the person whose labeler code is included in the proposed NDC.

<P>(a) Registration of an establishment or listing of a drug does not denote approval of the establishment, the drug, or other drugs of the establishment, nor does it mean that a product may be legally marketed. Any representation that creates an impression of official approval or that a drug is approved or is legally marketable because of registration or listing is misleading and constitutes misbranding.
</P>
<P>(b) FDA's acceptance of registration and listing information, inclusion of a drug in our database of drugs, or assignment of an NDC does not denote approval of the establishment or the drug or any other drugs of the establishment, nor does it mean that the drug may be legally marketed. Any representation that creates the impression that a drug is approved or is legally marketable because it appears in our database of drugs, has been assigned or displays an NDC, or the establishment has been assigned an establishment registration number or Unique Facility Identifier is misleading and constitutes misbranding. Failure to comply with § 207.37 may also constitute misbranding.
</P>
<P>(c) Neither registration nor listing constitutes a determination by FDA that a product is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Registration or listing may, however, be evidence that a facility intends to or does manufacture, repack, relabel, distribute, or salvage drugs or that a product is intended to be a drug.

<HEAD>§ 211.132   Tamper-evident packaging requirements for over-the-counter (OTC) human drug products.</HEAD>
<XREF ID="20240618" REFID="104">Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 51769, June 18, 2024.</XREF>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> The Food and Drug Administration has the authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) to establish a uniform national requirement for tamper-evident packaging of OTC drug products that will improve the security of OTC drug packaging and help assure the safety and effectiveness of OTC drug products. An OTC drug product (except a dermatological, dentifrice, insulin, or lozenge product) for retail sale that is not packaged in a tamper-resistant package or that is not properly labeled under this section is adulterated under section 501 of the act or misbranded under section 502 of the act, or both.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Requirements for tamper-evident package.</I> (1) Each manufacturer and packer who packages an OTC drug product (except a dermatological, dentifrice, insulin, or lozenge product) for retail sale shall package the product in a tamper-evident package, if this product is accessible to the public while held for sale. A tamper-evident package is one having one or more indicators or barriers to entry which, if breached or missing, can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering has occurred. To reduce the likelihood of successful tampering and to increase the likelihood that consumers will discover if a product has been tampered with, the package is required to be distinctive by design or by the use of one or more indicators or barriers to entry that employ an identifying characteristic (e.g., a pattern, name, registered trademark, logo, or picture). For purposes of this section, the term “distinctive by design” means the packaging cannot be duplicated with commonly available materials or through commonly available processes. A tamper-evident package may involve an immediate-container and closure system or secondary-container or carton system or any combination of systems intended to provide a visual indication of package integrity. The tamper-evident feature shall be designed to and shall remain intact when handled in a reasonable manner during manufacture, distribution, and retail display.
</P>
<P>(2) In addition to the tamper-evident packaging feature described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any two-piece, hard gelatin capsule covered by this section must be sealed using an acceptable tamper-evident technology.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Labeling.</I> (1) In order to alert consumers to the specific tamper-evident feature(s) used, each retail package of an OTC drug product covered by this section (except ammonia inhalant in crushable glass ampules, containers of compressed medical oxygen, or aerosol products that depend upon the power of a liquefied or compressed gas to expel the contents from the container) is required to bear a statement that:
</P>
<P>(i) Identifies all tamper-evident feature(s) and any capsule sealing technologies used to comply with paragraph (b) of this section;
</P>
<P>(ii) Is prominently placed on the package; and
</P>
<P>(iii) Is so placed that it will be unaffected if the tamper-evident feature of the package is breached or missing.
</P>
<P>(2) If the tamper-evident feature chosen to meet the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section uses an identifying characteristic, that characteristic is required to be referred to in the labeling statement. For example, the labeling statement on a bottle with a shrink band could say “For your protection, this bottle has an imprinted seal around the neck.”
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Request for exemptions from packaging and labeling requirements.</I> A manufacturer or packer may request an exemption from the packaging and labeling requirements of this section. A request for an exemption is required to be submitted in the form of a citizen petition under § 10.30 of this chapter and should be clearly identified on the envelope as a “Request for Exemption from the Tamper-Evident Packaging Rule.” The petition is required to contain the following:
</P>
<P>(1) The name of the drug product or, if the petition seeks an exemption for a drug class, the name of the drug class, and a list of products within that class.
</P>
<P>(2) The reasons that the drug product's compliance with the tamper-evident packaging or labeling requirements of this section is unnecessary or cannot be achieved.
</P>
<P>(3) A description of alternative steps that are available, or that the petitioner has already taken, to reduce the likelihood that the product or drug class will be the subject of malicious adulteration.
</P>
<P>(4) Other information justifying an exemption.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>OTC drug products subject to approved new drug applications.</I> Holders of approved new drug applications for OTC drug products are required under § 314.70 of this chapter to provide the agency with notification of changes in packaging and labeling to comply with the requirements of this section. Changes in packaging and labeling required by this regulation may be made before FDA approval, as provided under § 314.70(c) of this chapter. Manufacturing changes by which capsules are to be sealed require prior FDA approval under § 314.70(b) of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970.</I> This section does not affect any requirements for “special packaging” as defined under § 310.3(l) of this chapter and required under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970.

</P>
<P>(1) In the case of a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of declaring the quantity of a device in terms of linear measure or measure of area, such respective term may be used. Such term shall be augmented when necessary for accuracy of information by a statement of the weight, measure, or size of the individual units or of the entire device. 
</P>
<P>(2) If the declaration of contents for a device by numerical count does not give accurate information as to the quantity of the device in the package, it shall be augmented by such statement of weight, measure, or size of the individual units or of the total weight, measure, or size of the device as will give such information; for example, “100 tongue depressors, adult size”, “1 rectal syringe, adult size”, etc. Whenever the Commissioner determines for a specific packaged device that an existing practice of declaring net quantity of contents by weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination of these does not facilitate value comparisions by consumers, he shall by regulation designate the appropriate term or terms to be used for such article. 
</P>
<P>(b) Statements of weight of the contents shall be expressed in terms of avoirdupois pound and ounce. A statement of liquid measure of the contents shall be expressed in terms of the U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, and fluid-ounce subdivisions thereof, and shall express the volume at 68 °F (20 °C). See also paragraph (p) of this section. 
</P>
<P>(c) The declaration may contain common or decimal fractions. A common fraction shall be in terms of halves, quarters, eighths, sixteenths, or thirty-seconds; except that if there exists a firmly established, general consumer usage and trade custom of employing different common fractions in the net quantity declaration of a particular commodity, they may be employed. A common fraction shall be reduced to its lowest terms; a decimal fraction shall not be carried out to more than two places. A statement that includes small fractions of an ounce shall be deemed to permit smaller variations than one which does not include such fractions. 
</P>
<P>(d) The declaration shall be located on the principal display panel of the label, and with respect to packages bearing alternate principal panels it shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. 
</P>
<P>(e) The declaration shall appear as a distinct item on the principal display panel, shall be separated, by at least a space equal to the height of the lettering used in the declaration, from other printed label information appearing above or below the declaration and, by at least a space equal to twice the width of the letter “N” of the style of type used in the quantity of contents statement, from other printed label information appearing to the left or right of the declaration. It shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count, such as “giant pint” and “full quart”, that tends to exaggerate. It shall be placed on the principal display panel within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed: <I>Provided,</I> That: 
</P>
<P>(1) On packages having a principal display panel of 5 square inches or less the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel shall not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of this part; and

<P>(2) In the case of a device that is marketed with both outer and inner retail containers bearing the mandatory label information required by this part and the inner container is not intended to be sold separately, the net quantity of contents placement requirement of this section applicable to such inner container is waived. 
</P>
<P>(3) The principal display panel of a device marketed on a display card to which the immediate container is affixed may be considered to be the display panel of the card, and the type size of the net quantity of contents statement is governed by the dimensions of the display card. 
</P>
<P>(f) The declaration shall accurately reveal the quantity of device in the package exclusive of wrappers and other material packed therewith. 
</P>
<P>(g) The declaration shall appear in conspicuous and easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast (by typography, layout, color, embossing, or molding) to other matter on the package; except that a declaration of net quantity blown, embossed, or molded on a glass or plastic surface is permissible when all label information is so formed on the surface. Requirements of conspicuousness and legibility shall include the specifications that: 
</P>
<P>(1) The ratio of height to width of the letter shall not exceed a differential of 3 units to 1 unit, i.e., no more than 3 times as high as it is wide. 
</P>
<P>(2) Letter heights pertain to upper case or capital letters. When upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower case letter “o” or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum standards. 
</P>
<P>(3) When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one-half the minimum height standards. 
</P>
<P>(h) The declaration shall be in letters and numerals in a type size established in relationship to the area of the principal display panel of the package and shall be uniform for all packages of substantially the same size by complying with the following type specifications:

<P>(1) The declaration shall be expressed both in ounces, with identification by weight or by liquid measure and, if applicable (1 pound or 1 pint or more) followed in parentheses by a declaration in pounds for weight units, with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pound (see examples set forth in paragraphs (k) (1) and (2) of this section), or in the case of liquid measure, in the largest whole units (quarts, quarts and pints, or pints, as appropriate) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart (see examples set forth in paragraphs (k) (3) and (4) of this section). If the net weight of the package is less than 1 ounce avoirdupois or the net fluid measure is less than 1 fluid ounce, the declaration shall be in terms of common or decimal fractions of the respective ounce and not in terms of drams. 
</P>
<P>(2) The declaration may appear in more than one line. The term “net weight” shall be used when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of weight. Use of the terms “net” or “net contents” in terms of fluid measure or numerical count is optional. It is sufficient to distinguish avoirdupois ounce from fluid ounce through association of terms; for example, “Net wt. 6 oz” or “6 oz net wt.,” and “6 fl oz” or “net contents 6 fl oz.” 
</P>
<P>(j) On packages containing 4 pounds or 1 gallon or more and labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure, the declaration shall be expressed in pounds for weight units with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pound; in the case of fluid measure, it shall be expressed in the largest whole unit, i.e., gallons, followed by common or decimal fractions of a gallon or by the next smaller whole unit or units (quarts or quarts and pints), with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart; see paragraph (k)(5) of this section. 
</P>
<P>(k) <I>Examples:</I> (1) A declaration of 1
<FR>1/2</FR> pounds weight shall be expressed as “net wt. 24 oz (1 lb 8 oz),” or “Net wt. 24 oz (1
<FR>1/2</FR> lb)” or “Net wt. 24 oz (1.5 lb).” 
</P>
<P>(2) A declaration of three-fourths pound avoirdupois weight shall be expressed as “Net wt. 12 oz.”. 
</P>
<P>(3) A declaration of 1 quart liquid measure shall be expressed as “Net contents 32 fl oz (1 qt)” or “32 fl oz (1 qt).” 
</P>
<P>(4) A declaration of 1
<FR>3/4</FR> quarts liquid measure shall be expressed as, “Net contents 56 fl oz (1 qt 1 pt 8 oz)” or “Net contents 56 fl oz (1 qt 1.5 pt),” but not in terms of quart and ounce such as “Net contents 56 fl oz (1 qt 24 oz).” 
</P>
<P>(5) A declaration of 2
<FR>1/2</FR> gallons liquid measure shall be expressed as “Net contents 2 gal 2 qt”, “Net contents 2.5 gallons,” or “Net contents 2
<FR>1/2</FR> gal” but not as “2 gal 4 pt”.

<DIV8 N="801.405" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="8">
<HEAD>§ 801.405   Labeling of articles intended for lay use in the repairing and/or refitting of dentures.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The American Dental Association and leading dental authorities have advised the Food and Drug Administration of their concern regarding the safety of denture reliners, repair kits, pads, cushions, and other articles marketed and labeled for lay use in the repairing, refitting, or cushioning of ill-fitting, broken, or irritating dentures. It is the opinion of dental authorities and the Food and Drug Administration that to properly repair and properly refit dentures a person must have professional knowledge and specialized technical skill. Laymen cannot be expected to maintain the original vertical dimension of occlusion and the centric relation essential in the proper repairing or refitting of dentures. The continued wearing of improperly repaired or refitted dentures may cause acceleration of bone resorption, soft tissue hyperplasia, and other irreparable damage to the oral cavity. Such articles designed for lay use should be limited to emergency or temporary situations pending the services of a licensed dentist. 
</P>
<P>(b) The Food and Drug Administration therefore regards such articles as unsafe and misbranded under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, unless the labeling: 
</P>
<P>(1)(i) Limits directions for use for denture repair kits to emergency repairing pending unavoidable delay in obtaining professional reconstruction of the denture; 
</P>
<P>(ii) Limits directions for use for denture reliners, pads, and cushions to temporary refitting pending unavoidable delay in obtaining professional reconstruction of the denture; 
</P>
<P>(2) Contains in a conspicuous manner the word “emergency” preceding and modifying each indication-for-use statement for denture repair kits and the word “temporary” preceding and modifying each indication-for-use statement for reliners, pads, and cushions; and 
</P>
<P>(3) Includes a conspicuous warning statement to the effect: 
</P>
<P>(i) For denture repair kits: <I>“Warning—For emergency repairs only.</I> Long term use of home-repaired dentures may cause faster bone loss, continuing irritation, sores, and tumors. This kit for emergency use only. See Dentist Without Delay.” 
</P>
<P>(ii) For denture reliners, pads, and cushions: <I>“Warning—For temporary use only.</I> Longterm use of this product may lead to faster bone loss, continuing irritation, sores, and tumors. For Use Only Until a Dentist Can Be Seen.” 
</P>
<P>(c) Adequate directions for use require full information of the temporary and emergency use recommended in order for the layman to understand the limitations of usefulness, the reasons therefor, and the importance of adhering to the warnings. Accordingly, the labeling should contain substantially the following information: 
</P>
<P>(1) For denture repair kits: Special training and tools are needed to repair dentures to fit properly. Home-repaired dentures may cause irritation to the gums and discomfort and tiredness while eating. Long term use may lead to more troubles, even permanent changes in bones, teeth, and gums, which may make it impossible to wear dentures in the future. For these reasons, dentures repaired with this kit should be used only in an emergency until a dentist can be seen. Dentures that don't fit properly cause irritation and injury to the gums and faster bone loss, which is permanent. Dentures that don't fit properly cause gum changes that may require surgery for correction. Continuing irritation and injury may lead to cancer in the mouth. You must see your dentist as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>(2) For denture reliners, pads, and cushions: Use of these preparations or devices may temporarily decrease the discomfort; however, their use will not make the denture fit properly. Special training and tools are needed to repair a denture to fit properly. Dentures that do not fit properly cause irritation and injury to the gums and faster bone loss, which is permanent and may require a completely new denture. Changes in the gums caused by dentures that do not fit properly may require surgery for correction. Continuing irritation and injury may lead to cancer in the mouth. You must see your dentist as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>(3) If the denture relining or repairing material forms a permanent bond with the denture, a warning statement to the following effect should be included: “This reliner becomes fixed to the denture and a completely new denture may be required because of its use.” 
</P>
<P>(d) Labeling claims exaggerating the usefulness or the safety of the material or failing to disclose all facts relevant to the claims of usefulness will be regarded as false and misleading under sections 201(n) and 502(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. 
</P>
<P>(e) Regulatory action may be initiated with respect to any article found within the jurisdiction of the act contrary to the provisions of this policy statement after 90 days following the date of publication of this section in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

<HEAD>§ 801.410   Use of impact-resistant lenses in eyeglasses and sunglasses.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Examination of data available on the frequency of eye injuries resulting from the shattering of ordinary crown glass lenses indicates that the use of such lenses constitutes an avoidable hazard to the eye of the wearer. 
</P>
<P>(b) The consensus of the ophthalmic community is that the number of eye injuries would be substantially reduced by the use in eyeglasses and sunglasses of impact-resistant lenses. 
</P>
<P>(c)(1) To protect the public more adequately from potential eye injury, eyeglasses and sunglasses must be fitted with impact-resistant lenses, except in those cases where the physician or optometrist finds that such lenses will not fulfill the visual requirements of the particular patient, directs in writing the use of other lenses, and gives written notification thereof to the patient. 
</P>
<P>(2) The physician or optometrist shall have the option of ordering glass lenses, plastic lenses, or laminated glass lenses made impact resistant by any method; however, all such lenses shall be capable of withstanding the impact test described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. 
</P>
<P>(3) Each finished impact-resistant glass lens for prescription use shall be individually tested for impact resistance and shall be capable of withstanding the impact test described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Raised multifocal lenses shall be impact resistant but need not be tested beyond initial design testing. Prism segment multifocal, slab-off prism, lenticular cataract, iseikonic, depressed segment one-piece multifocal, bioconcave, myodisc and minus lenticular, custom laminate and cemented assembly lenses shall be impact resistant but need not be subjected to impact testing. To demonstrate that all other types of impact-resistant lenses, including impact-resistant laminated glass lenses (i.e., lenses other than those described in the three preceding sentences of this paragraph (c)(3)), are capable of withstanding the impact test described in this regulation, the manufacturer of these lenses shall subject to an impact test a statistically significant sampling of lenses from each production batch, and the lenses so tested shall be representative of the finished forms as worn by the wearer, including finished forms that are of minimal lens thickness and have been subjected to any treatment used to impart impact resistance. All nonprescription lenses and plastic prescription lenses tested on the basis of statistical significance shall be tested in uncut-finished or finished form. 
</P>
<P>(d)(1) For the purpose of this regulation, the impact test described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be the “referee test,” defined as “one which will be utilized to determine compliance with a regulation.” The referee test provides the Food and Drug Administration with the means of examining a medical device for performance and does not inhibit the manufacturer from using equal or superior test methods. A lens manufacturer shall conduct tests of lenses using the impact test described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section or any equal or superior test. Whatever test is used, the lenses shall be capable of withstanding the impact test described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section if the Food and Drug Administration examines them for performance. 
</P>
<P>(2) In the impact test, a 
<FR>5/8</FR>-inch steel ball weighing approximately 0.56 ounce is dropped from a height of 50 inches upon the horizontal upper surface of the lens. The ball shall strike within a 
<FR>5/8</FR>-inch diameter circle located at the geometric center of the lens. The ball may be guided but not restricted in its fall by being dropped through a tube extending to within approximately 4 inches of the lens. To pass the test, the lens must not fracture; for the purpose of this section, a lens will be considered to have fractured if it cracks through its entire thickness, including a laminar layer, if any, and across a complete diameter into two or more separate pieces, or if any lens material visible to the naked eyes becomes detached from the ocular surface. The test shall be conducted with the lens supported by a tube (1-inch inside diameter, 1
<FR>1/4</FR>-inch outside diameter, and approximately 1-inch high) affixed to a rigid iron or steel base plate. The total weight of the base plate and its rigidly attached fixtures shall be not less than 27 pounds. For lenses of small minimum diameter, a support tube having an outside diameter of less than 1
<FR>1/4</FR> inches may be used. The support tube shall be made of rigid acrylic plastic, steel, or other suitable substance and shall have securely bonded on the top edge a 
<FR>1/8</FR>- by 
<FR>1/8</FR>-inch neoprene gasket having a hardness of 40 ±5, as determined by ASTM Method D 1415-88, “Standard Test Method for Rubber Property—International Hardness” a minimum tensile strength of 1,200 pounds, as determined by ASTM Method D 412-98A, “Standard Test Methods for Vulcanized Rubber and Thermoplastic Elastomers—Tension,” and a minimum ultimate elongation of 400 percent, as determined by ASTM Method D 412-68 (Both methods are incorporated by reference and are available from the American Society for Testing Materials, 100 Barr Harbor Dr., West Conshohocken, Philadelphia, PA 19428, or available for inspection at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health's Library, 9200 Corporate Blvd., Rockville, MD 20850, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <I>http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.</I> The diameter or contour of the lens support may be modified as necessary so that the 
<FR>1/8</FR>- by 
<FR>1/8</FR>-inch neoprene gasket supports the lens at its periphery.
</P>
<P>(e) Copies of invoice(s), shipping document(s), and records of sale or distribution of all impact resistant lenses, including finished eyeglasses and sunglasses, shall be kept and maintained for a period of 3 years; however, the names and addresses of individuals purchasing nonprescription eyeglasses and sunglasses at the retail level need not be kept and maintained by the retailer. The records kept in compliance with this paragraph shall be made available upon request at all reasonable hours by any officer or employee of the Food and Drug Administration or by any other officer or employee acting on behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services and such officer or employee shall be permitted to inspect and copy such records, to make such inventories of stock as he deems necessary, and otherwise to check the correctness of such inventories. 
</P>
<P>(f) In addition, those persons conducting tests in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section shall maintain the results thereof and a description of the test method and of the test apparatus for a period of 3 years. These records shall be made available upon request at any reasonable hour by any officer or employee acting on behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The persons conducting tests shall permit the officer or employee to inspect and copy the records, to make such inventories of stock as the officer or employee deems necessary, and otherwise to check the correctness of the inventories. 
</P>
<P>(g) For the purpose of this section, the term “manufacturer” includes an importer for resale. Such importer may have the tests required by paragraph (d) of this section conducted in the country of origin but must make the results thereof available, upon request, to the Food and Drug Administration, as soon as practicable. 
</P>
<P>(h) All lenses must be impact-resistant except when the physician or optometrist finds that impact-resistant lenses will not fulfill the visual requirements for a particular patient. 
</P>
<P>(i) This statement of policy does not apply to contact lenses.

<HEAD>§ 801.415   Maximum acceptable level of ozone.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Ozone is a toxic gas with no known useful medical application in specific, adjunctive, or preventive therapy. In order for ozone to be effective as a germicide, it must be present in a concentration far greater than that which can be safely tolerated by man and animals. 
</P>
<P>(b) Although undesirable physiological effects on the central nervous system, heart, and vision have been reported, the predominant physiological effect of ozone is primary irritation of the mucous membranes. Inhalation of ozone can cause sufficient irritation to the lungs to result in pulmonary edema. The onset of pulmonary edema is usually delayed for some hours after exposure; thus, symptomatic response is not a reliable warning of exposure to toxic concentrations of ozone. Since olfactory fatigue develops readily, the odor of ozone is not a reliable index of atmospheric ozone concentration. 
</P>
<P>(c) A number of devices currently on the market generate ozone by design or as a byproduct. Since exposure to ozone above a certain concentration can be injurious to health, any such device will be considered adulterated and/or misbranded within the meaning of sections 501 and 502 of the act if it is used or intended for use under the following conditions: 
</P>
<P>(1) In such a manner that it generates ozone at a level in excess of 0.05 part per million by volume of air circulating through the device or causes an accumulation of ozone in excess of 0.05 part per million by volume of air (when measured under standard conditions at 25 °C (77 °F) and 760 millimeters of mercury) in the atmosphere of enclosed space intended to be occupied by people for extended periods of time, e.g., houses, apartments, hospitals, and offices. This applies to any such device, whether portable or permanent or part of any system, which generates ozone by design or as an inadvertent or incidental product. 
</P>
<P>(2) To generate ozone and release it into the atmosphere in hospitals or other establishments occupied by the ill or infirm. 
</P>
<P>(3) To generate ozone and release it into the atmosphere and does not indicate in its labeling the maximum acceptable concentration of ozone which may be generated (not to exceed 0.05 part per million by volume of air circulating through the device) as established herein and the smallest area in which such device can be used so as not to produce an ozone accumulation in excess of 0.05 part per million. 
</P>
<P>(4) In any medical condition for which there is no proof of safety and effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>(5) To generate ozone at a level less than 0.05 part per million by volume of air circulating through the device and it is labeled for use as a germicide or deodorizer. 
</P>
<P>(d) This section does not affect the present threshold limit value of 0.10 part per million (0.2 milligram per cubic meter) of ozone exposure for an 8-hour-day exposure of industrial workers as recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. 
</P>
<P>(e) The method and apparatus specified in 40 CFR part 50, or any other equally sensitive and accurate method, may be employed in measuring ozone pursuant to this section.

<P>(2) The package label shall include an explanation of the ranges of absorbency and a description of how consumers can use a range of absorbency, and its corresponding absorbency term, to make comparisons of absorbency of tampons to allow selection of the tampons with the minimum absorbency needed to control menstrual flow in order to reduce the risk of contracting TSS.
</P>
<P>(f) A manufacturer shall measure the absorbency of individual tampons using the test method specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section and calculate the mean absorbency of a production run, lot, or batch by rounding to the nearest 0.1 gram.
</P>
<P>(1) A manufacturer shall design and implement a sampling plan that includes collection of probability samples of adequate size to yield consistent tolerance intervals such that the probability is 90 percent that at least 90 percent of the absorbencies of individual tampons within a brand and type are within the range of absorbency stated on the package label.

<P>(2) In the absorbency test, an unlubricated condom, with tensile strength between 17 Mega Pascals (MPa) and 30 MPa, as measured according to the procedure in the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D 3492-97, “Standard Specification for Rubber Contraceptives (Male Condoms)” 
<SU>1</SU>
<FTREF/> for determining tensile strength, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a), is attached to the large end of a glass chamber (or a chamber made from hard transparent plastic) with a rubber band (see figure 1) and pushed through the small end of the chamber using a smooth, finished rod. The condom is pulled through until all slack is removed. The tip of the condom is cut off and the remaining end of the condom is stretched over the end of the tube and secured with a rubber band. A preweighed (to the nearest 0.01 gram) tampon is placed within the condom membrane so that the center of gravity of the tampon is at the center of the chamber. An infusion needle (14 gauge) is inserted through the septum created by the condom tip until it contacts the end of the tampon. The outer chamber is filled with water pumped from a temperature-controlled waterbath to maintain the average temperature at 27±1 °C. The water returns to the waterbath as shown in figure 2. Syngyna fluid (10 grams sodium chloride, 0.5 gram Certified Reagent Acid Fushsin, 1,000 milliliters distilled water) is then pumped through the infusion needle at a rate of 50 milliliters per hour. The test shall be terminated when the tampon is saturated and the first drop of fluid exits the apparatus. (The test result shall be discarded if fluid is detected in the folds of the condom before the tampon is saturated). The water is then drained and the tampon is removed and immediately weighed to the nearest 0.01 gram. The absorbency of the tampon is determined by subtracting its dry weight from this value. The condom shall be replaced after 10 tests or at the end of the day during which the condom is used in testing, whichever occurs first.

<HEAD>§ 801.435   User labeling for latex condoms.</HEAD>
<P>(a) This section applies to the subset of condoms as identified in § 884.5300 of this chapter, and condoms with spermicidal lubricant as identified in § 884.5310 of this chapter, which products are formed from latex films.
</P>
<P>(b) Data show that the material integrity of latex condoms degrade over time. To protect the public health and minimize the risk of device failure, latex condoms must bear an expiration date which is supported by testing as described in paragraphs (d) and (h) of this section.
</P>
<P>(c) The expiration date, as demonstrated by testing procedures required by paragraphs (d) and (h) of this section, must be displayed prominently and legibly on the primary packaging (i.e., individual package), and higher levels of packaging (e.g., boxes of condoms), in order to ensure visibility of the expiration date by consumers.
</P>
<P>(d) Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, the expiration date must be supported by data demonstrating physical and mechanical integrity of the product after three discrete and representative lots of the product have been subjected to each of the following conditions:
</P>
<P>(1) Storage of unpackaged bulk product for the maximum amount of time the manufacturer allows the product to remain unpackaged, followed by storage of the packaged product at 70 °C (plus or minus 2 °C) for 7 days;
</P>
<P>(2) Storage of unpackaged bulk product for the maximum amount of time the manufacturer allows the product to remain unpackaged, followed by storage of the packaged product at a selected temperature between 40 and 50 °C (plus or minus 2 °C) for 90 days; and
</P>
<P>(3) Storage of unpackaged bulk product for the maximum amount of time the manufacturer allows the product to remain unpackaged, followed by storage of the packaged product at a monitored or controlled temperature between 15 and 30 °C for the lifetime of the product (real time storage).
</P>
<P>(e) If a product fails the physical and mechanical integrity tests commonly used by industry after the completion of the accelerated storage tests described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, the product expiration date must be demonstrated by real time storage conditions described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. If all of the products tested after storage at temperatures as described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section pass the manufacturer's physical and mechanical integrity tests, the manufacturer may label the product with an expiration date of up to 5 years from the date of product packaging. If the extrapolated expiration date under paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section is used, the labeled expiration date must be confirmed by physical and mechanical integrity tests performed at the end of the stated expiration period as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. If the data from tests following real time storage described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section fails to confirm the extrapolated expiration date, the manufacturer must, at that time, relabel the product to reflect the actual shelf life.
</P>
<P>(f) Products that already have established shelf life data based upon real time storage and testing and have such storage and testing data available for inspection are not required to confirm such data using accelerated and intermediate aging data described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. If, however, such real time expiration dates were based upon testing of products that were not first left unpackaged for the maximum amount of time as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the real time testing must be confirmed by testing products consistent with the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. This testing shall be initiated no later than the effective date of this regulation. Until the confirmation testing in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section is completed, the product may remain on the market labeled with the expiration date based upon previous real time testing.
</P>
<P>(g) If a manufacturer uses testing data from one product to support expiration dating on any variation of that product, the manufacturer must document and provide, upon request, an appropriate justification for the application of the testing data to the variation of the tested product.
</P>
<P>(h) If a latex condom contains a spermicide, and the expiration date based on spermicidal stability testing is different from the expiration date based upon latex integrity testing, the product shall bear only the earlier expiration date.
</P>
<P>(i) The time period upon which the expiration date is based shall start with the date of packaging.
</P>
<P>(j) As provided in part 820 of this chapter, all testing data must be retained in each company's files, and shall be made available upon request for inspection by the Food and Drug Administration.

<HEAD>§ 803.3   How does FDA define the terms used in this part?</HEAD>
<P>Some of the terms we use in this part are specific to medical device reporting and reflect the language used in the statute (law). Other terms are more general and reflect our interpretation of the law. This section defines the following terms as used in this part:
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Ambulatory surgical facility (ASF)</I> means a distinct entity that operates for the primary purpose of furnishing same day outpatient surgical services to patients. An ASF may be either an independent entity (i.e., not a part of a provider of services or any other facility) or operated by another medical entity (e.g., under the common ownership, licensure, or control of an entity). An ASF is subject to this regulation regardless of whether it is licensed by a Federal, State, municipal, or local government or regardless of whether it is accredited by a recognized accreditation organization. If an adverse event meets the criteria for reporting, the ASF must report that event regardless of the nature or location of the medical service provided by the ASF.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Become aware</I> means that an employee of the entity required to report has acquired information that reasonably suggests a reportable adverse event has occurred.
</P>
<P>(1) If you are a device user facility, you are considered to have “become aware” when medical personnel, as defined in this section, who are employed by or otherwise formally affiliated with your facility, obtain information about a reportable event.
</P>
<P>(2) If you are a manufacturer, you are considered to have become aware of an event when any of your employees becomes aware of a reportable event that is required to be reported within 30 calendar days or that is required to be reported within 5 work days because we had requested reports in accordance with § 803.53(b). You are also considered to have become aware of an event when any of your employees with management or supervisory responsibilities over persons with regulatory, scientific, or technical responsibilities, or whose duties relate to the collection and reporting of adverse events, becomes aware, from any information, including any trend analysis, that a reportable MDR event or events necessitates remedial action to prevent an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health.
</P>
<P>(3) If you are an importer, you are considered to have become aware of an event when any of your employees becomes aware of a reportable event that is required to be reported by you within 30 days.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Caused or contributed</I> means that a death or serious injury was or may have been attributed to a medical device, or that a medical device was or may have been a factor in a death or serious injury, including events occurring as a result of:
</P>
<P>(1) Failure,
</P>
<P>(2) Malfunction,

</P>
<P>(d) <I>Device user facility</I> means a hospital, ambulatory surgical facility, nursing home, outpatient diagnostic facility, or outpatient treatment facility as defined in this section, which is not a physician's office, as defined in this section. School nurse offices and employee health units are not device user facilities.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Distributor</I> means any person (other than the manufacturer or importer) who furthers the marketing of a device from the original place of manufacture to the person who makes final delivery or sale to the ultimate user, but who does not repackage or otherwise change the container, wrapper, or labeling of the device or device package. If you repackage or otherwise change the container, wrapper, or labeling, you are considered a manufacturer as defined in this section.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Expected life of a device</I> means the time that a device is expected to remain functional after it is placed into use. Certain implanted devices have specified “end of life” (EOL) dates. Other devices are not labeled as to their respective EOL, but are expected to remain operational through activities such as maintenance, repairs, or upgrades, for an estimated period of time.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>FDA, we, us, or Agency</I> means the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Five-day report</I> means a medical device report that must be submitted by a manufacturer to us under § 803.53 within 5 work days.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Hospital</I> means a distinct entity that operates for the primary purpose of providing diagnostic, therapeutic (such as medical, occupational, speech, physical), surgical, and other patient services for specific and general medical conditions. Hospitals include general, chronic disease, rehabilitative, psychiatric, and other special-purpose facilities. A hospital may be either independent (e.g., not a part of a provider of services or any other facility) or may be operated by another medical entity (e.g., under the common ownership, licensure, or control of another entity). A hospital is covered by this regulation regardless of whether it is licensed by a Federal, State, municipal or local government or whether it is accredited by a recognized accreditation organization. If an adverse event meets the criteria for reporting, the hospital must report that event regardless of the nature or location of the medical service provided by the hospital.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Importer</I> means any person who imports a device into the United States and who furthers the marketing of a device from the original place of manufacture to the person who makes final delivery or sale to the ultimate user, but who does not repackage or otherwise change the container, wrapper, or labeling of the device or device package. If you repackage or otherwise change the container, wrapper, or labeling, you are considered a manufacturer as defined in this section.
</P>
<P>(k) <I>Malfunction</I> means the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or otherwise perform as intended. Performance specifications include all claims made in the labeling for the device. The intended performance of a device refers to the intended use for which the device is labeled or marketed, as defined in § 801.4 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(l) <I>Manufacturer</I> means any person who manufactures, prepares, propagates, compounds, assembles, or processes a device by chemical, physical, biological, or other procedure. The term includes any person who either:

</P>
<P>(4) Is the U.S. agent of a foreign manufacturer.
</P>
<P>(m) <I>Manufacturer or importer report number.</I> This number uniquely identifies each individual adverse event report submitted by a manufacturer or importer. This number consists of the following three parts:
</P>
<P>(1) The FDA registration number for the manufacturing site of the reported device, or the registration number for the importer. If the manufacturing site or the importer does not have an establishment registration number, we will assign a temporary MDR reporting number until the site is registered in accordance with part 807 of this chapter. We will inform the manufacturer or importer of the temporary MDR reporting number;
</P>
<P>(2) The four-digit calendar year in which the report is submitted; and
</P>
<P>(3) The five-digit sequence number of the reports submitted during the year, starting with 00001. (For example, the complete number will appear as follows: 1234567-2011-00001.)

</P>
<P>(i) The manufacturer and to us, no later than 30 calendar days after the day that you become aware of information that reasonably suggests that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or
</P>
<P>(ii) The manufacturer, no later than 30 calendar days after receiving information that a device you market has malfunctioned and that this device or a similar device that you market would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.
</P>
<P>(3) If you are a manufacturer, you must submit MDR reports to us:
</P>
<P>(i) No later than 30 calendar days after the day that you become aware of information that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or

<P>(iii) Within 5 work days if required by § 803.53.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>What kind of information reasonably suggests that a reportable event has occurred?</I>
</P>
<P>(1) Any information, including professional, scientific, or medical facts, observations, or opinions, may reasonably suggest that a device has caused or may have caused or contributed to an MDR reportable event. An MDR reportable event is a death, a serious injury, or, if you are a manufacturer or importer, a malfunction that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.
</P>
<P>(2) If you are a user facility, importer, or manufacturer, you do not have to report an adverse event if you have information that would lead a person who is qualified to make a medical judgment reasonably to conclude that a device did not cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or that a malfunction would not be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. Persons qualified to make a medical judgment include physicians, nurses, risk managers, and biomedical engineers. You must keep in your MDR event files (described in § 803.18) the information that the qualified person used to determine whether or not a device-related event was reportable.

<P>(a) <I>Introduction.</I> This part prescribes procedures for the submission, review, and approval of applications for exemption from Federal preemption of State and local requirements applicable to medical devices under section 521 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>General rule for State and local requirements respecting devices.</I> Section 521(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act contains special provisions governing the regulation of devices by States and localities. That section prescribes a general rule that after May 28, 1976, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect any requirement with respect to a medical device intended for human use having the force and effect of law (whether established by statute, ordinance, regulation, or court decision), which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable to such device under any provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Exempting from preemption certain State or local requirements respecting devices.</I> Section 521(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act contains a provision whereby the Commissioner of Food and Drugs may, upon application by a State or political subdivision, allow imposition of a requirement which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to the device (and which is thereby preempted) by promulgating a regulation in accordance with this part exempting the State or local requirement from preemption. The granting of an exemption does not affect the applicability to the device of any requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Commissioner may promulgate an exemption regulation for the preempted requirement if he makes either of the following findings:
</P>
<P>(1) That the requirement is more stringent than a requirement under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act applicable to the device; or
</P>
<P>(2) That the requirement is required by compelling local conditions and compliance with the requirement would not cause the device to be in violation of any applicable requirement under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Meaning of “requirements applicable to a device.”</I> State or local requirements are preempted only when the Food and Drug Administration has established specific counterpart regulations or there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, thereby making any existing divergent State or local requirements applicable to the device different from, or in addition to, the specific Food and Drug Administration requirements. There are other State or local requirements that affect devices that are not preempted by section 521(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because they are not “requirements applicable to a device” within the meaning of section 521(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The following are examples of State or local requirements that are not regarded as preempted by section 521 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act:
</P>
<P>(1) Section 521(a) does not preempt State or local requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates either to other products in addition to devices (e.g., requirements such as general electrical codes, and the Uniform Commercial Code (warranty of fitness)), or to unfair trade practices in which the requirements are not limited to devices.
</P>
<P>(2) Section 521(a) does not preempt State or local requirements that are equal to, or substantially identical to, requirements imposed by or under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P>(3) Section 521(a) does not preempt State or local permits, licensing, registration, certification, or other requirements relating to the approval or sanction of the practice of medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, nursing, podiatry, or any other of the healing arts or allied medical sciences or related professions or occupations that administer, dispense, or sell devices. However, regulations issued under section 520(e) or (g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act may impose restrictions on the sale, distribution, or use of a device beyond those prescribed in State or local requirements. If there is a conflict between such restrictions and State or local requirements, the Federal regulations shall prevail.
</P>
<P>(4) Section 521(a) does not preempt specifications in contracts entered into by States or localities for procurement of devices.
</P>
<P>(5) Section 521(a) does not preempt criteria for payment of State or local obligations under Medicaid and similar Federal, State or local health-care programs.
</P>
<P>(6)(i) Section 521(a) does not preempt State or local requirements respecting general enforcement, e.g., requirements that State inspection be permitted of factory records concerning all devices, registration, and licensing requirements for manufacturers and others, and prohibition of manufacture of devices in unlicensed establishments. However, Federal regulations issued under sections 519 and 520(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act may impose requirements for records and reports and good manufacturing practices beyond those prescribed in State or local requirements. If there is a conflict between such regulations and State or local requirements, the Federal regulations shall prevail. 
</P>
<P>(ii) Generally, section 521(a) does not preempt a State or local requirement prohibiting the manufacture of adulterated or misbranded devices. Where, however, such a prohibition has the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device, e.g., a specific labeling requirement, then the prohibition will be preempted if the requirement is different from, or in addition to, a Federal requirement established under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In determining whether such a requirement is preempted, the determinative factor is how the requirement is interpreted and enforced by the State or local government and not the literal language of the statute, which may be identical to a provision in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P>(7) Section 521(a) does not preempt State or local provisions respecting delegations of authority and related administrative matters relating to devices.
</P>
<P>(8) Section 521(a) does not preempt a State or local requirement whose sole purpose is raising revenue or charging fees for services, registration, or regulatory programs.
</P>
<P>(9) Section 521(a) does not preempt State or local requirements of the types that have been developed under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 note), as amended, Subchapter C—Electronic Product Radiation Control of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (formerly the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968), and other Federal statutes, until such time as the Food and Drug Administration issues specific requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act applicable to these types of devices.
</P>
<P>(10) Part 820 of this chapter (21 CFR part 820) (CGMP requirements) does not preempt remedies created by States or Territories of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Determination of equivalence or difference of requirements applicable to a device.</I> It is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration, subject to review by Federal courts, to determine whether a State or local requirement is equal to, or substantially identical to, requirements imposed by or under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or is different from, or in addition to, such requirements, in accordance with the procedures provided by this part. However, it is the responsibility of States and political subdivisions to determine initially whether to seek exemptions from preemption. Any State or political subdivision whose requirements relating to devices are preempted by section 521(a) may petition the Commissioner of Food and Drugs for exemption from preemption, in accordance with the procedures provided by this part.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Applicability of Federal requirements respecting devices.</I> The Federal requirement with respect to a device applies whether or not a corresponding State or local requirement is preempted or exempted from preemption. As a result, if a State or local requirement that the Food and Drug Administration has exempted from preemption is not as broad in its application as the Federal requirement, the Federal requirement applies to all circumstances not covered by the State or local requirement.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Exemptions not applicable to certain State or local government requirements specifically related to hearing products.</I> An exemption under this part shall not apply to any State or local government law, regulation, order, or other requirement specifically related to hearing products, including any requirement for the supervision, prescription, or other order, involvement, or intervention of a licensed person for consumers to access over-the-counter hearing aids, that:
</P>
<P>(1) Would restrict or interfere with the servicing, marketing, sale, dispensing, use, customer support, or distribution of over-the-counter hearing aids, as defined under section 520(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, through in-person transactions, by mail, or online; and
</P>
<P>(2) Is different from, in addition to, or otherwise not identical to, the regulations issued under section 709(b) of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017.

<P>(1) A requirement with respect to a device for which an application for exemption from preemption has been submitted under § 808.20 is not preempted by section 521(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because it is: (i) Equal to or substantially identical to a requirement under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act applicable to the device, or (ii) is not a requirement within the meaning of section 521 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and therefore is not preempted;
</P>
<P>(2) A proposed State or local requirement with respect to a device is not eligible for exemption from preemption because the State or local requirement has not been issued in final form. In such a case, the advisory opinion may indicate whether the proposed requirement would be preempted and, if it would be preempted, whether the Food and Drug Administration would propose to grant an exemption from preemption;

<DIV8 N="808.20" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="8">
<HEAD>§ 808.20   Application.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Any State or political subdivision may apply to the Food and Drug Administration for an exemption from preemption for any requirement that it has enacted and that is preempted. An exemption may only be granted for a requirement that has been enacted, promulgated, or issued in final form by the authorized body or official of the State or political subdivision so as to have the force and effect of law. However, an application for exemption may be submitted before the effective date of the requirement.
</P>
<P>(b) An application for exemption shall be in the form of a letter to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and shall be signed by an individual who is authorized to request the exemption on behalf of the State or political subdivision. An original and two copies of the letter and any accompanying material, as well as any subsequent reports or correspondence concerning an application, shall be submitted to the Dockets Management Staff (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. The outside wrapper of any application, report, or correspondence should indicate that it concerns an application for exemption from preemption of device requirements. 
</P>
<P>(c) For each requirement for which an exemption is sought, the application shall include the following information to the fullest extent possible, or an explanation of why such information has not been included:
</P>
<P>(1) Identification and a current copy of any statute, rule, regulation, or ordinance of the State or political subdivision considered by the State or political subdivision to be a requirement which is preempted, with a reference to the date of enactment, promulgation, or issuance in final form. The application shall also include, where available, copies of any legislative history or background materials pertinent to enactment, promulgation, or issuance of the requirement, including hearing reports or studies concerning development or consideration of the requirement. If the requirement has been subject to any judicial or administrative interpretations, the State or political subdivision shall furnish copies of such judicial or administrative interpretations.
</P>
<P>(2) A comparison of the requirement of the State or political subdivision and any applicable Federal requirements to show similarities and differences. 
</P>
<P>(3) Information on the nature of the problem addressed by the requirement of the State or political subdivision.
</P>
<P>(4) Identification of which (or both) of the following bases is relied upon for seeking an exemption from preemption:
</P>
<P>(i) The requirement is more stringent than a requirement applicable to a device under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If the State or political subdivision relies upon this basis for exemption from preemption, the application shall include information, data, or material showing how and why the requirement of the State or political subdivision is more stringent than requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P>(ii) The requirement is required by compelling local conditions, and compliance with the requirement would not cause the device to be in violation of any applicable requirement under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If the State or political subdivision relies upon this basis for exemption from preemption, the application shall include information, data, or material showing why compliance with the requirement of the State or political subdivision would not cause a device to be in violation of any applicable requirement under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and why the requirement is required by compelling local conditions. The application shall also explain in detail the compelling local conditions that justify the requirement.
</P>
<P>(5) The title of the chief administrative or legal officers of that State or local agency that has primary responsibility for administration of the requirement.
</P>
<P>(6) When requested by the Food and Drug Administration, any records concerning administration of any requirement which is the subject of an exemption or an application for an exemption from preemption.
</P>
<P>(7) Information on how the public health may be benefitted and how interstate commerce may be affected, if an exemption is granted.
</P>
<P>(8) Any other pertinent information respecting the requirement voluntarily submitted by the applicant.
</P>
<P>(d) If litigation regarding applicability of the requirement is pending, the State or political subdivision may so indicate in its application and request expedited action on such application.

<P>(a) Upon receipt of an application for an exemption from preemption submitted in accordance with § 808.20, the Commissioner shall notify the State or political subdivision of the date of such receipt.
</P>
<P>(b) If the Commissioner finds that an application does not meet the requirements of § 808.20, he shall notify the State or political subdivision of the deficiencies in the application and of the opportunity to correct such deficiencies. A deficient application may be corrected at any time.
</P>
<P>(c) After receipt of an application meeting the requirements of § 808.20, the Commissioner shall review such application and determine whether to grant or deny an exemption from preemption for each requirement which is the subject of the application. The Commissioner shall then issue in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a proposed regulation either to grant or to deny an exemption from preemption. The Commissioner shall also issue in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a notice of opportunity to request an oral hearing before the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee.
</P>
<P>(d) A request for an oral hearing may be made by the State or political subdivision or any other interested person. Such request shall be submitted to the Dockets Management Staff within the period of time prescribed in the notice and shall include an explanation of why an oral hearing, rather than submission of written comments only, is essential to the presentation of views on the application for exemption from preemption and the proposed regulation. 
</P>
<P>(e) If a timely request for an oral hearing is made, the Commissioner shall review such a request and may grant a legislative-type informal oral hearing pursuant to part 15 of this chapter by publishing in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a notice of the hearing in accordance with § 15.20 of this chapter. The scope of the oral hearing shall be limited to matters relevant to the application for exemption from preemption and the proposed regulation. Oral or written presentations at the oral hearing which are not relevant to the application shall be excluded from the administrative record of the hearing.
</P>
<P>(f) If a request for hearing is not timely made or a notice of appearance is not filed pursuant to § 15.21 of this chapter, the Commissioner shall consider all written comments submitted and publish a final rule in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. 
</P>
<P>(g)(1) The Commissioner shall review all written comments submitted on the proposed rule and the administrative record of the oral hearing, if an oral hearing has been granted, and shall publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a final rule in subpart C of this part identifying any requirement in the application for which exemption from preemption is granted, or conditionally granted, and any requirement in the application for which exemption from preemption is not granted.
</P>
<P>(2) The Commissioner may issue a regulation granting or conditionally granting an application for an exemption from preemption for any requirement if the Commissioner makes either of the following findings:
</P>
<P>(i) The requirement is more stringent than a requirement applicable to the device under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;
</P>
<P>(ii) The requirement is required by compelling local conditions, and compliance with the requirement would not cause the device to be in violation of any requirement applicable to the device under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P>(3) The Commissioner may not grant an application for an exemption from preemption for any requirement with respect to a device if the Commissioner determines that the granting of an exemption would not be in the best interest of public health, taking into account the potential burden on interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>(h) An advisory opinion pursuant to § 808.5 or a regulation pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section constitutes final agency action.

Under § 16.22(b) of this chapter, this timeframe ordinarily will not be fewer than 3 working days after receipt of the cease distribution and notification order. However, as provided in § 16.60(h) of this chapter, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs or presiding officer may waive, suspend, or modify any provision of part 16 under § 10.19 of this chapter, including those pertaining to the timing of the hearing. As provided in § 16.26(a), the Commissioner or presiding officer may deny a request for a hearing, in whole or in part, if he or she determines that no genuine and substantial issue of fact is raised by the material submitted in the request.
</P>
<P>(b) If a request for a regulatory hearing is granted, the regulatory hearing shall be limited to:
</P>
<P>(1) Reviewing the actions required by the cease distribution and notification order, determining if FDA should affirm, modify, or vacate the order, and addressing an appropriate cease distribution and notification strategy; and
</P>
<P>(2) Determining whether FDA should amend the cease distribution and notification order to require a recall of the device that was the subject of the order.

</P>
<P>(c) If a request by the person named in a cease distribution and notification order for a regulatory hearing is granted, the regulatory hearing will be conducted in accordance with the procedures set out in section 201(x) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(x)) and part 16 of this chapter, except that the order issued under § 810.10, rather than a notice under § 16.22(a) of this chapter, provides the notice of opportunity for a hearing and is part of the administrative record of the regulatory hearing under § 16.80(a) of this chapter. As provided in § 16.60(h) of this chapter, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs or presiding officer may waive, suspend, or modify any provision of part 16 under § 10.19 of this chapter. As provided in § 16.26(b), after the hearing commences, the presiding officer may issue a summary decision on any issue if the presiding officer determines that there is no genuine and substantial issue of fact respecting that issue.
</P>
<P>(d) If the person named in the cease distribution and notification order does not request a regulatory hearing within the timeframe specified by FDA in the cease distribution and notification order, that person will be deemed to have waived his or her right to request a hearing.
</P>
<P>(e) The presiding officer will ordinarily hold any regulatory hearing requested under paragraph (a) of this section no fewer than 2 working days after receipt of the request for a hearing, under § 16.24(e) of this chapter, and no later than 10 working days after the date of issuance of the cease distribution and notification order. However, FDA and the person named in the order may agree to a later date or the presiding officer may determine that the hearing should be held in fewer than 2 days. Moreover, as provided for in § 16.60(h) of this chapter, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs or presiding officer may waive, suspend, or modify any provision of part 16 under § 10.19 of this chapter, including those pertaining to the timing of the hearing. After the presiding officer prepares a written report of the hearing and the agency issues a final decision based on the report, the presiding officer shall provide the requestor written notification of the final decision to affirm, modify, or vacate the order or to amend the order to require a recall of the device within 15 working days of conducting a regulatory hearing.

<HEAD>§ 812.1   Scope.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The purpose of this part is to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use, and to that end to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of this purpose. This part provides procedures for the conduct of clinical investigations of devices. An approved investigational device exemption (IDE) permits a device that otherwise would be required to comply with a performance standard or to have premarket approval to be shipped lawfully for the purpose of conducting investigations of that device. An IDE approved under § 812.30 or considered approved under § 812.2(b) exempts a device from the requirements of the following sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) and regulations issued thereunder: Misbranding under section 502 of the act, registration, listing, and premarket notification under section 510, performance standards under section 514, premarket approval under section 515, a banned device regulation under section 516, records and reports under section 519, restricted device requirements under section 520(e), good manufacturing practice requirements under section 520(f) except for the requirements found in § 820.30, if applicable (unless the sponsor states an intention to comply with these requirements under § 812.20(b)(3) or § 812.140(b)(4)(v)) and color additive requirements under section 721.

<P>(a) <I>Changes in investigational plan</I>—(1) <I>Changes requiring prior approval.</I> Except as described in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4) of this section, a sponsor must obtain approval of a supplemental application under § 812.30(a), and IRB approval when appropriate (see §§ 56.110 and 56.111 of this chapter), prior to implementing a change to an investigational plan. If a sponsor intends to conduct an investigation that involves an exception to informed consent under § 50.24 of this chapter, the sponsor shall submit a separate investigational device exemption (IDE) application in accordance with § 812.20(a).
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Changes effected for emergency use.</I> The requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section regarding FDA approval of a supplement do not apply in the case of a deviation from the investigational plan to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. Such deviation shall be reported to FDA within 5-working days after the sponsor learns of it (see § 812.150(a)(4)).
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Changes effected with notice to FDA within 5 days.</I> A sponsor may make certain changes without prior approval of a supplemental application under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the sponsor determines that these changes meet the criteria described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section, on the basis of credible information defined in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, and the sponsor provides notice to FDA within 5-working days of making these changes.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Developmental changes.</I> The requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section regarding FDA approval of a supplement do not apply to developmental changes in the device (including manufacturing changes) that do not constitute a significant change in design or basic principles of operation and that are made in response to information gathered during the course of an investigation.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Changes to clinical protocol.</I> The requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section regarding FDA approval of a supplement do not apply to changes to clinical protocols that do not affect:
</P>
<P>(A) The validity of the data or information resulting from the completion of the approved protocol, or the relationship of likely patient risk to benefit relied upon to approve the protocol;
</P>
<P>(B) The scientific soundness of the investigational plan; or
</P>
<P>(C) The rights, safety, or welfare of the human subjects involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Definition of credible information.</I> (A) Credible information to support developmental changes in the device (including manufacturing changes) includes data generated under the design control procedures of § 820.30, preclinical/animal testing, peer reviewed published literature, or other reliable information such as clinical information gathered during a trial or marketing.
</P>
<P>(B) Credible information to support changes to clinical protocols is defined as the sponsor's documentation supporting the conclusion that a change does not have a significant impact on the study design or planned statistical analysis, and that the change does not affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects. Documentation shall include information such as peer reviewed published literature, the recommendation of the clinical investigator(s), and/or the data gathered during the clinical trial or marketing.
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>Notice of IDE change.</I> Changes meeting the criteria in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section that are supported by credible information as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section may be made without prior FDA approval if the sponsor submits a notice of the change to the IDE not later than 5-working days after making the change. Changes to devices are deemed to occur on the date the device, manufactured incorporating the design or manufacturing change, is distributed to the investigator(s). Changes to a clinical protocol are deemed to occur when a clinical investigator is notified by the sponsor that the change should be implemented in the protocol or, for sponsor-investigator studies, when a sponsor-investigator incorporates the change in the protocol. Such notices shall be identified as a “notice of IDE change.”
</P>
<P>(A) For a developmental or manufacturing change to the device, the notice shall include a summary of the relevant information gathered during the course of the investigation upon which the change was based; a description of the change to the device or manufacturing process (cross-referenced to the appropriate sections of the original device description or manufacturing process); and, if design controls were used to assess the change, a statement that no new risks were identified by appropriate risk analysis and that the verification and validation testing, as appropriate, demonstrated that the design outputs met the design input requirements. If another method of assessment was used, the notice shall include a summary of the information which served as the credible information supporting the change.
</P>
<P>(B) For a protocol change, the notice shall include a description of the change (cross-referenced to the appropriate sections of the original protocol); an assessment supporting the conclusion that the change does not have a significant impact on the study design or planned statistical analysis; and a summary of the information that served as the credible information supporting the sponsor's determination that the change does not affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Changes submitted in annual report.</I> The requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not apply to minor changes to the purpose of the study, risk analysis, monitoring procedures, labeling, informed consent materials, and IRB information that do not affect:
</P>
<P>(i) The validity of the data or information resulting from the completion of the approved protocol, or the relationship of likely patient risk to benefit relied upon to approve the protocol;
</P>
<P>(ii) The scientific soundness of the investigational plan; or
</P>
<P>(iii) The rights, safety, or welfare of the human subjects involved in the investigation. Such changes shall be reported in the annual progress report for the IDE, under § 812.150(b)(5).
</P>
<P>(b) <I>IRB approval for new facilities.</I> A sponsor shall submit to FDA a certification of any IRB approval of an investigation or a part of an investigation not included in the IDE application. If the investigation is otherwise unchanged, the supplemental application shall consist of an updating of the information required by § 812.20(b) and (c) and a description of any modifications in the investigational plan required by the IRB as a condition of approval. A certification of IRB approval need not be included in the initial submission of the supplemental application, and such certification is not a precondition for agency consideration of the application. Nevertheless, a sponsor may not begin a part of an investigation at a facility until the IRB has approved the investigation, FDA has received the certification of IRB approval, and FDA, under § 812.30(a), has approved the supplemental application relating to that part of the investigation (see § 56.103(a)).

<HEAD>§ 812.36   Treatment use of an investigational device.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> A device that is not approved for marketing may be under clinical investigation for a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition in patients for whom no comparable or satisfactory alternative device or other therapy is available. During the clinical trial or prior to final action on the marketing application, it may be appropriate to use the device in the treatment of patients not in the trial under the provisions of a treatment investigational device exemption (IDE). The purpose of this section is to facilitate the availability of promising new devices to desperately ill patients as early in the device development process as possible, before general marketing begins, and to obtain additional data on the device's safety and effectiveness. In the case of a serious disease, a device ordinarily may be made available for treatment use under this section after all clinical trials have been completed. In the case of an immediately life-threatening disease, a device may be made available for treatment use under this section prior to the completion of all clinical trials. For the purpose of this section, an “immediately life-threatening” disease means a stage of a disease in which there is a reasonable likelihood that death will occur within a matter of months or in which premature death is likely without early treatment. For purposes of this section, “treatment use”of a device includes the use of a device for diagnostic purposes.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Criteria.</I> FDA shall consider the use of an investigational device under a treatment IDE if:
</P>
<P>(1) The device is intended to treat or diagnose a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition;
</P>
<P>(2) There is no comparable or satisfactory alternative device or other therapy available to treat or diagnose that stage of the disease or condition in the intended patient population;
</P>
<P>(3) The device is under investigation in a controlled clinical trial for the same use under an approved IDE, or such clinical trials have been completed; and
</P>
<P>(4) The sponsor of the investigation is actively pursuing marketing approval/clearance of the investigational device with due diligence.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Applications for treatment use.</I> (1) A treatment IDE application shall include, in the following order:
</P>
<P>(i) The name, address, and telephone number of the sponsor of the treatment IDE;
</P>
<P>(ii) The intended use of the device, the criteria for patient selection, and a written protocol describing the treatment use;
</P>
<P>(iii) An explanation of the rationale for use of the device, including, as appropriate, either a list of the available regimens that ordinarily should be tried before using the investigational device or an explanation of why the use of the investigational device is preferable to the use of available marketed treatments;
</P>
<P>(iv) A description of clinical procedures, laboratory tests, or other measures that will be used to evaluate the effects of the device and to minimize risk;
</P>
<P>(v) Written procedures for monitoring the treatment use and the name and address of the monitor;
</P>
<P>(vi) Instructions for use for the device and all other labeling as required under § 812.5(a) and (b);
</P>
<P>(vii) Information that is relevant to the safety and effectiveness of the device for the intended treatment use. Information from other IDE's may be incorporated by reference to support the treatment use;
</P>
<P>(viii) A statement of the sponsor's commitment to meet all applicable responsibilities under this part and part 56 of this chapter and to ensure compliance of all participating investigators with the informed consent requirements of part 50 of this chapter;
</P>
<P>(ix) An example of the agreement to be signed by all investigators participating in the treatment IDE and certification that no investigator will be added to the treatment IDE before the agreement is signed; and
</P>
<P>(x) If the device is to be sold, the price to be charged and a statement indicating that the price is based on manufacturing and handling costs only.
</P>
<P>(2) A licensed practitioner who receives an investigational device for treatment use under a treatment IDE is an “investigator” under the IDE and is responsible for meeting all applicable investigator responsibilities under this part and parts 50 and 56 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>FDA action on treatment IDE applications</I>—(1) <I>Approval of treatment IDE's.</I> Treatment use may begin 30 days after FDA receives the treatment IDE submission at the address specified in § 812.19, unless FDA notifies the sponsor in writing earlier than the 30 days that the treatment use may or may not begin. FDA may approve the treatment use as proposed or approve it with modifications.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Disapproval or withdrawal of approval of treatment IDE's.</I> FDA may disapprove or withdraw approval of a treatment IDE if:
</P>
<P>(i) The criteria specified in § 812.36(b) are not met or the treatment IDE does not contain the information required in § 812.36(c);
</P>
<P>(ii) FDA determines that any of the grounds for disapproval or withdrawal of approval listed in § 812.30(b)(1) through (b)(5) apply;
</P>
<P>(iii) The device is intended for a serious disease or condition and there is insufficient evidence of safety and effectiveness to support such use;
</P>
<P>(iv) The device is intended for an immediately life-threatening disease or condition and the available scientific evidence, taken as a whole, fails to provide a reasonable basis for concluding that the device:
</P>
<P>(A) May be effective for its intended use in its intended population; or
</P>
<P>(B) Would not expose the patients to whom the device is to be administered to an unreasonable and significant additional risk of illness or injury;
</P>
<P>(v) There is reasonable evidence that the treatment use is impeding enrollment in, or otherwise interfering with the conduct or completion of, a controlled investigation of the same or another investigational device;
</P>
<P>(vi) The device has received marketing approval/clearance or a comparable device or therapy becomes available to treat or diagnose the same indication in the same patient population for which the investigational device is being used;
</P>
<P>(vii) The sponsor of the controlled clinical trial is not pursuing marketing approval/clearance with due diligence;
</P>
<P>(viii) Approval of the IDE for the controlled clinical investigation of the device has been withdrawn; or
</P>
<P>(ix) The clinical investigator(s) named in the treatment IDE are not qualified by reason of their scientific training and/or experience to use the investigational device for the intended treatment use.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Notice of disapproval or withdrawal.</I> If FDA disapproves or proposes to withdraw approval of a treatment IDE, FDA will follow the procedures set forth in § 812.30(c).
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Safeguards.</I> Treatment use of an investigational device is conditioned upon the sponsor and investigators complying with the safeguards of the IDE process and the regulations governing informed consent (part 50 of this chapter) and institutional review boards (part 56 of this chapter).
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Reporting requirements.</I> The sponsor of a treatment IDE shall submit progress reports on a semi-annual basis to all reviewing IRB's and FDA until the filing of a marketing application. These reports shall be based on the period of time since initial approval of the treatment IDE and shall include the number of patients treated with the device under the treatment IDE, the names of the investigators participating in the treatment IDE, and a brief description of the sponsor's efforts to pursue marketing approval/clearance of the device. Upon filing of a marketing application, progress reports shall be submitted annually in accordance with § 812.150(b)(5). The sponsor of a treatment IDE is responsible for submitting all other reports required under § 812.150.

<P>(a) If FDA has information indicating that an investigator (including a sponsor-investigator) has repeatedly or deliberately failed to comply with the requirements of this part, part 50, or part 56 of this chapter, or has repeatedly or deliberately submitted to FDA or to the sponsor false information in any required report, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research will furnish the investigator written notice of the matter complained of and offer the investigator an opportunity to explain the matter in writing, or, at the option of the investigator, in an informal conference. If an explanation is offered and accepted by the applicable Center, the Center will discontinue the disqualification proceeding. If an explanation is offered but not accepted by the applicable Center, the investigator will be given an opportunity for a regulatory hearing under part 16 of this chapter on the question of whether the investigator is eligible to receive test articles under this part and eligible to conduct any clinical investigation that supports an application for a research or marketing permit for products regulated by FDA.
</P>
<P>(b) After evaluating all available information, including any explanation presented by the investigator, if the Commissioner determines that the investigator has repeatedly or deliberately failed to comply with the requirements of this part, part 50, or part 56 of this chapter, or has repeatedly or deliberately submitted to FDA or to the sponsor false information in any required report, the Commissioner will notify the investigator, the sponsor of any investigation in which the investigator has been named as a participant, and the reviewing investigational review boards (IRBs) that the investigator is not eligible to receive test articles under this part. The notification to the investigator, sponsor and IRBs will provide a statement of the basis for such determination. The notification also will explain that an investigator determined to be ineligible to receive test articles under this part will be ineligible to conduct any clinical investigation that supports an application for a research or marketing permit for products regulated by FDA, including drugs, biologics, devices, new animal drugs, foods, including dietary supplements, that bear a nutrient content claim or a health claim, infant formulas, food and color additives, and tobacco products.
</P>
<P>(c) Each application or submission to FDA under the provisions of this chapter containing data reported by an investigator who has been determined to be ineligible to receive FDA-regulated test articles is subject to examination to determine whether the investigator has submitted unreliable data that are essential to the continuation of an investigation or essential to the clearance or approval of a marketing application, or essential to the continued marketing of an FDA-regulated product.
</P>
<P>(d) If the Commissioner determines, after the unreliable data submitted by the investigator are eliminated from consideration, that the data remaining are inadequate to support a conclusion that it is reasonably safe to continue the investigation, the Commissioner will notify the sponsor, who shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing under part 16 of this chapter. If a danger to the public health exists, however, the Commissioner shall terminate the investigational device exemption (IDE) immediately and notify the sponsor and the reviewing IRBs of the termination. In such case, the sponsor shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before FDA under part 16 of this chapter on the question of whether the IDE should be reinstated. The determination that an investigation may not be considered in support of a research or marketing application or a notification or petition submission does not, however, relieve the sponsor of any obligation under any other applicable regulation to submit to FDA the results of the investigation.
</P>
<P>(e) If the Commissioner determines, after the unreliable data submitted by the investigator are eliminated from consideration, that the continued clearance or approval of the product for which the data were submitted cannot be justified, the Commissioner will proceed to rescind clearance or withdraw approval of the product in accordance with the applicable provisions of the relevant statutes.
</P>
<P>(f) An investigator who has been determined to be ineligible under paragraph (b) of this section may be reinstated as eligible when the Commissioner determines that the investigator has presented adequate assurances that the investigator will employ all test articles, and will conduct any clinical investigation that supports an application for a research or marketing permit for products regulated by FDA, solely in compliance with the applicable provisions of this chapter.

<HEAD>§ 814.39   PMA supplements.</HEAD>
<P>(a) After FDA's approval of a PMA, an applicant shall submit a PMA supplement for review and approval by FDA before making a change affecting the safety or effectiveness of the device for which the applicant has an approved PMA, unless the change is of a type for which FDA, under paragraph (e) of this section, has advised that an alternate submission is permitted or is of a type which, under section 515(d)(6)(A) of the act and paragraph (f) of this section, does not require a PMA supplement under this paragraph. While the burden for determining whether a supplement is required is primarily on the PMA holder, changes for which an applicant shall submit a PMA supplement include, but are not limited to, the following types of changes if they affect the safety or effectiveness of the device:
</P>
<P>(1) New indications for use of the device. 
</P>
<P>(2) Labeling changes. 
</P>
<P>(3) The use of a different facility or establishment to manufacture, process, or package the device. 
</P>
<P>(4) Changes in sterilization procedures. 
</P>
<P>(5) Changes in packaging. 
</P>
<P>(6) Changes in the performance or design specifications, circuits, components, ingredients, principle of operation, or physical layout of the device. 
</P>
<P>(7) Extension of the expiration date of the device based on data obtained under a new or revised stability or sterility testing protocol that has not been approved by FDA. If the protocol has been approved, the change shall be reported to FDA under paragraph (b) of this section. 
</P>
<P>(b) An applicant may make a change in a device after FDA's approval of a PMA for the device without submitting a PMA supplement if the change does not affect the device's safety or effectiveness and the change is reported to FDA in post approval periodic reports required as a condition to approval of the device, <I>e.g.,</I> an editorial change in labeling which does not affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, or if the change is consistent with a predetermined change control plan (PCCP) approved under section 515C of the act. 
</P>
<P>(c)(1) All procedures and actions that apply to an application under § 814.20 also apply to PMA supplements except that the information required in a supplement is limited to that needed to support the change. A summary under § 814.20(b)(3) is required for only a supplement submitted for new indications for use of the device, significant changes in the performance or design specifications, circuits, components, ingredients, principles of operation, or physical layout of the device, or when otherwise required by FDA. The applicant shall submit a PMA supplement in electronic format and shall include information relevant to the proposed changes in the device. A PMA supplement shall include a separate section that identifies each change for which approval is being requested and explains the reason for each such change. The applicant shall submit additional information, if requested by FDA, in electronic format. The time frames for review of, and FDA action on, a PMA supplement are the same as those provided in § 814.40 for a PMA.
</P>
<P>(2) The supplement must include the following information:
</P>
<P>(i) Information concerning pediatric uses as required under § 814.20(b)(13).
</P>
<P>(ii) If information concerning the device that is the subject of the supplement was previously submitted under § 814.20(b)(13) or under this section in a previous supplement, that information may be included by referencing a previous application or submission that contains the information. However, if additional information required under § 814.20(b)(13) has become readily available to the applicant since the previous submission, the applicant must submit that information as part of the supplement.
</P>
<P>(d)(1) After FDA approves a PMA, any change described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section to reflect newly acquired information that enhances the safety of the device or the safety in the use of the device may be placed into effect by the applicant prior to the receipt under § 814.17 of a written FDA order approving the PMA supplement provided that:
</P>
<P>(i) The PMA supplement and its mailing cover are plainly marked “Special PMA Supplement—Changes Being Effected”; 
</P>
<P>(ii) The PMA supplement provides a full explanation of the basis for the changes; 
</P>
<P>(iii) The applicant has received acknowledgement from FDA of receipt of the supplement; and 
</P>
<P>(iv) The PMA supplement specifically identifies the date that such changes are being effected. 
</P>
<P>(2) The following changes are permitted by paragraph (d)(1) of this section: 
</P>
<P>(i) Labeling changes that add or strengthen a contraindication, warning, precaution, or information about an adverse reaction for which there is reasonable evidence of a causal association.
</P>
<P>(ii) Labeling changes that add or strengthen an instruction that is intended to enhance the safe use of the device. 
</P>
<P>(iii) Labeling changes that delete misleading, false, or unsupported indications. 
</P>
<P>(iv) Changes in quality controls or manufacturing process that add a new specification or test method, or otherwise provide additional assurance of purity, identity, strength, or reliability of the device. 
</P>
<P>(e)(1) FDA will identify a change to a device for which an applicant has an approved PMA and for which a PMA supplement under paragraph (a) is not required. FDA will identify such a change in an advisory opinion under § 10.85, if the change applies to a generic type of device, or in correspondence to the applicant, if the change applies only to the applicant's device. FDA will require that a change for which a PMA supplement under paragraph (a) is not required be reported to FDA in:
</P>
<P>(i) A periodic report under § 814.84 or
</P>
<P>(ii) A 30-day PMA supplement under this paragraph.
</P>
<P>(2) FDA will identify, in the advisory opinion or correspondence, the type of information that is to be included in the report or 30-day PMA supplement. If the change is required to be reported to FDA in a periodic report, the change may be made before it is reported to FDA. If the change is required to be reported in a 30-day PMA supplement, the change may be made 30 days after FDA files the 30-day PMA supplement unless FDA requires the PMA holder to provide additional information, informs the PMA holder that the supplement is not approvable, or disapproves the supplement. The 30-day PMA supplement shall follow the instructions in the correspondence or advisory opinion. Any 30-day PMA supplement that does not meet the requirements of the correspondence or advisory opinion will not be filed and, therefore, will not be deemed approved 30 days after receipt.
</P>
<P>(f) Under section 515(d) of the act, modifications to manufacturing procedures or methods of manufacture that affect the safety and effectiveness of a device subject to an approved PMA do not require submission of a PMA supplement under paragraph (a) of this section and are eligible to be the subject of a 30-day notice. A 30-day notice shall describe in detail the change, summarize the data or information supporting the change, and state that the change has been made in accordance with the requirements of part 820 of this chapter. The manufacturer may distribute the device 30 days after the date on which FDA receives the 30-day notice, unless FDA notifies the applicant within 30 days from receipt of the notice that the notice is not adequate. If the notice is not adequate, FDA shall inform the applicant in writing that a 135-day PMA supplement is needed and shall describe what further information or action is required for acceptance of such change. The number of days under review as a 30-day notice shall be deducted from the 135-day PMA supplement review period if the notice meets appropriate content requirements for a PMA supplement.
</P>
<P>(g) The submission and grant of a written request for an exception or alternative under § 801.128 or § 809.11 of this chapter satisfies the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section.

<P>A device included in this part that is classified into class III (premarket approval) shall not be commercially distributed after the date shown in the regulation classifying the device unless the manufacturer has an approval under section 515 of the act (unless an exemption has been granted under section 520(g)(2) of the act). An approval under section 515 of the act consists of FDA's issuance of an order approving an application for premarket approval (PMA) for the device or declaring completed a product development protocol (PDP) for the device. 
</P>
<P>(a) Before FDA requires that a device commercially distributed before the enactment date of the amendments, or a device that has been found substantially equivalent to such a device, has an approval under section 515 of the act FDA must promulgate a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring such approval, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Such a regulation under section 515(b) of the act shall not be effective during the grace period ending on the 90th day after its promulgation or on the last day of the 30th full calendar month after the regulation that classifies the device into class III is effective, whichever is later. See section 501(f)(2)(B) of the act. Accordingly, unless an effective date of the requirement for premarket approval is shown in the regulation for a device classified into class III in this part, the device may be commercially distributed without FDA's issuance of an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device. If FDA promulgates a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring premarket approval for a device, section 501(f)(1)(A) of the act applies to the device.

<P>(b) Any new, not substantially equivalent, device introduced into commercial distribution on or after May 28, 1976, including a device formerly marketed that has been substantially altered, is classified by statute (section 513(f) of the act) into class III without any grace period and FDA must have issued an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device before the device is commercially distributed unless it is reclassified. If FDA knows that a device being commercially distributed may be a “new” device as defined in this section because of any new intended use or other reasons, FDA may codify the statutory classification of the device into class III for such new use. Accordingly, the regulation for such a class III device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution.

<HEAD>§ 886.1   Scope.</HEAD>
<P>(a) This part sets forth the classification of ophthalmic devices intended for human use that are in commercial distribution. 
</P>
<P>(b) The identification of a device in a regulation in this part is not a precise description of every device that is, or will be, subject to the regulation. A manufacturer who submits a premarket notification submission for a device under part 807 cannot show merely that the device is accurately described by the section title and identification provision of a regulation in this part but shall state why the device is substantially equivalent to other devices, as required by § 807.87. 
</P>
<P>(c) To avoid duplicative listings, an ophthalmic device that has two or more types of uses (e.g., used both as a diagnostic device and as a therapeutic device) is listed in one subpart only. 
</P>
<P>(d) References in this part to regulatory sections of the Code of Federal Regulations are to chapter I of title 21 unless otherwise noted.

<DIV8 N="886.3" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="8">
<HEAD>§ 886.3   Effective dates of requirement for premarket approval.</HEAD>
<P>A device included in this part that is classified into class III (premarket approval) shall not be commercially distributed after the date shown in the regulation classifying the device unless the manufacturer has an approval under section 515 of the act (unless an exemption has been granted under section 520(g)(2) of the act). An approval under section 515 of the act consists of FDA's issuance of an order approving an application for premarket approval (PMA) for the device or declaring completed a product development protocol (PDP) for the device. 
</P>
<P>(a) Before FDA requires that a device commercially distributed before the enactment date of the amendments, or a device that has been found substantially equivalent to such a device, has an approval under section 515 of the act, FDA must promulgate a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring such approval, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Such a regulation under section 515(b) of the act shall not be effective during the grace period ending on the 90th day after its promulgation or on the last day of the 30th full calendar month after the regulation that classifies the device into class III is effective, whichever is later. See section 501(f)(2)(B) of the act. Accordingly, unless an effective date of the requirement for premarket approval is shown in the regulation for a device classified into class III in this part, the device may be commercially distributed without FDA's issuance of an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device. If FDA promulgates a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring premarket approval for a device, section 501(f)(1)(A) of the act applies to the device. 
</P>
<P>(b) Any new, not substantially equivalent, device introduced into commercial distribution on or after May 28, 1976, including a device formerly marketed that has been substantially altered, is classified by statute (section 513(f) of the act) into class III without any grace period and FDA must have issued an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device before the device is commercially distributed unless it is reclassified. If FDA knows that a device being commercially distributed may be a “new” device as defined in this section because of any new intended use or other reasons, FDA may codify the statutory classification of the device into class III for such new use. Accordingly, the regulation for such a class III device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution. 
</P>
<P>(c) A device identified in a regulation in this part that is classified into class III and that is subject to the transitional provisions of section 520(1) of the act is automatically classified by statute into class III and must have an approval under section 515 of the act before being commercially distributed. Accordingly, the regulation for such a class III transitional device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution.

<HEAD>§ 886.9   Limitations of exemptions from section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act).</HEAD>
<P>The exemption from the requirement of premarket notification (section 510(k) of the act) for a generic type of class I or II device is only to the extent that the device has existing or reasonably foreseeable characteristics of commercially distributed devices within that generic type or, in the case of in vitro diagnostic devices, only to the extent that misdiagnosis as a result of using the device would not be associated with high morbidity or mortality. Accordingly, manufacturers of any commercially distributed class I or II device for which FDA has granted an exemption from the requirement of premarket notification must still submit a premarket notification to FDA before introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution the device when:
</P>
<P>(a) The device is intended for a use different from the intended use of a legally marketed device in that generic type of device; e.g., the device is intended for a different medical purpose, or the device is intended for lay use where the former intended use was by health care professionals only;
</P>
<P>(b) The modified device operates using a different fundamental scientific technology than a legally marketed device in that generic type of device; e.g., a surgical instrument cuts tissue with a laser beam rather than with a sharpened metal blade, or an in vitro diagnostic device detects or identifies infectious agents by using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe or nucleic acid hybridization technology rather than culture or immunoassay technology; or
</P>
<P>(c) The device is an in vitro device that is intended:
</P>
<P>(1) For use in the diagnosis, monitoring, or screening of neoplastic diseases with the exception of immunohistochemical devices;
</P>
<P>(2) For use in screening or diagnosis of familial or acquired genetic disorders, including inborn errors of metabolism;
</P>
<P>(3) For measuring an analyte that serves as a surrogate marker for screening, diagnosis, or monitoring life-threatening diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), chronic or active hepatitis, tuberculosis, or myocardial infarction or to monitor therapy;
</P>
<P>(4) For assessing the risk of cardiovascular diseases;
</P>
<P>(5) For use in diabetes management;
</P>
<P>(6) For identifying or inferring the identity of a microorganism directly from clinical material;
</P>
<P>(7) For detection of antibodies to microorganisms other than immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgG assays when the results are not qualitative, or are used to determine immunity, or the assay is intended for use in matrices other than serum or plasma;
</P>
<P>(8) For noninvasive testing as defined in § 812.3(k) of this chapter; and
</P>
<P>(9) For near patient testing (point of care).

<P>(a) This part sets forth the classification of orthopedic devices intended for human use that are in commercial distribution. 
</P>
<P>(b) The identification of a device in a regulation in this part is not a precise description of every device that is, or will be, subject to the regulation. A manufacturer who submits a premarket notification submission for a device under part 807 cannot show merely that the device is accurately described by the section title and identification provision of a regulation in this part, but shall state why the device is substantially equivalent to other devices, as required by § 807.87.

<DIV8 N="888.3" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="8">
<HEAD>§ 888.3   Effective dates of requirement for premarket approval.</HEAD>
<P>A device included in this part that is classified into class III (premarket approval) shall not be commercially distributed after the date shown in the regulation classifying the device unless the manufacturer has an approval under section 515 of the act (unless an exemption has been granted under section 520(g)(2) of the act). An approval under section 515 of the act consists of FDA's issuance of an order approving an application for premarket approval (PMA) for the device or declaring completed a product development protocol (PDP) for the device. 
</P>
<P>(a) Before FDA requires that a device commercially distributed before the enactment date of the amendments, or a device that has been found substantially equivalent to such a device, has an approval under section 515 of the act, FDA must promulgate a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring such approval, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Such a regulation under section 515(b) of the act shall not be effective during the grace period ending on the 90th day after its promulgation or on the last day of the 30th full calendar month after the regulation that classifies the device into class III is effective, whichever is later. See section 501(f)(2)(B) of the act. Accordingly, unless an effective date of the requirement for premarket approval is shown in the regulation for a device classified into class III in this part, the device may be commercially distributed without FDA's issuance of an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device. If FDA promulgates a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring premarket approval for a device, section 501(f)(1)(A) of the act applies to the device. 
</P>
<P>(b) Any new, not substantially equivalent, device introduced into commercial distribution on or after May 28, 1976, including a device formerly marketed that has been substantially altered, is classified by statute (section 513(f) of the act) into class III without any grace period and FDA must have issued an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device before the device is commercially distributed unless it is reclassified. If FDA knows that a device being commercially distributed may be a “new” device as defined in this section because of any new intended use or other reasons, FDA may codify the statutory classification of the device into class III for such new use. Accordingly, the regulation for such a class III device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution. 
</P>
<P>(c) A device identified in a regulation in this part that is classified into class III and that is subject to the transitional provisions of section 520(1) of the act is automatically classified by statute into class III and must have an approval under section 515 of the act before being commercially distributed. Accordingly, the regulation for such a class III transitional device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution.

<DIV8 N="888.5" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="8">
<HEAD>§ 888.5   Resurfacing technique.</HEAD>
<P>Because of resurfacing techniques, certain joint prostheses require far less bone resection than other devices intended to repair or replace the same joint. The amount of bone resection may or may not affect the safety and effectiveness of the implantation of the prosthesis. When a resurfacing technique is used, the name of the prosthesis includes this information.

<HEAD>§ 888.6   Degree of constraint.</HEAD>
<P>Certain joint prostheses provide more constraint of joint movement than others. FDA believes that the degree of constraint is an important factor affecting the safety and effectiveness of orthopedic prostheses. FDA is defining the following standard terms for categorizing the degree of constraint. 
</P>
<P>(a) A “constrained” joint prosthesis is used for joint replacement and prevents dislocation of the prosthesis in more than one anatomic plane and consists of either a single, flexible, across-the-joint component or more than one component linked together or affined. 
</P>
<P>(b) A “semi-constrained” joint prosthesis is used for partial or total joint replacement and limits translation and rotation of the prosthesis in one or more planes via the geometry of its articulating surfaces. It has no across-the-joint linkage. 
</P>
<P>(c) A “non-constrained” joint prosthesis is used for partial or total joint replacement and restricts minimally prosthesis movement in one or more planes. Its components have no across-the-joint linkage.

<HEAD>§ 888.9   Limitations of exemptions from section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act).</HEAD>
<P>The exemption from the requirement of premarket notification (section 510(k) of the act) for a generic type of class I or II device is only to the extent that the device has existing or reasonably foreseeable characteristics of commercially distributed devices within that generic type or, in the case of in vitro diagnostic devices, only to the extent that misdiagnosis as a result of using the device would not be associated with high morbidity or mortality. Accordingly, manufacturers of any commercially distributed class I or II device for which FDA has granted an exemption from the requirement of premarket notification must still submit a premarket notification to FDA before introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution the device when:
</P>
<P>(a) The device is intended for a use different from the intended use of a legally marketed device in that generic type of device; e.g., the device is intended for a different medical purpose, or the device is intended for lay use where the former intended use was by health care professionals only;
</P>
<P>(b) The modified device operates using a different fundamental scientific technology than a legally marketed device in that generic type of device; e.g., a surgical instrument cuts tissue with a laser beam rather than with a sharpened metal blade, or an in vitro diagnostic device detects or identifies infectious agents by using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe or nucleic acid hybridization technology rather than culture or immunoassay technology; or
</P>
<P>(c) The device is an in vitro device that is intended:
</P>
<P>(1) For use in the diagnosis, monitoring, or screening of neoplastic diseases with the exception of immunohistochemical devices;
</P>
<P>(2) For use in screening or diagnosis of familial or acquired genetic disorders, including inborn errors of metabolism;

</P>
<P>(5) For use in diabetes management;
</P>
<P>(6) For identifying or inferring the identity of a microorganism directly from clinical material;
</P>
<P>(7) For detection of antibodies to microorganisms other than immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgG assays when the results are not qualitative, or are used to determine immunity, or the assay is intended for use in matrices other than serum or plasma;
</P>

<HEAD>§ 1311.100   General.</HEAD>
<P>(a) This subpart addresses the requirements that must be met to issue and process Schedule II, III, IV, and V controlled substance prescriptions electronically.
</P>
<P>(b) A practitioner may issue a prescription for a Schedule II, III, IV, or V controlled substance electronically if all of the following conditions are met:
</P>
<P>(1) The practitioner is registered as an individual practitioner or exempt from the requirement of registration under part 1301 of this chapter and is authorized under the registration or exemption to dispense the controlled substance;
</P>
<P>(2) The practitioner uses an electronic prescription application that meets all of the applicable requirements of this subpart; and
</P>
<P>(3) The prescription is otherwise in conformity with the requirements of the Act and this chapter.
</P>
<P>(c) An electronic prescription for a Schedule II, III, IV, or V controlled substance created using an electronic prescription application that does not meet the requirements of this subpart is not a valid prescription, as that term is defined in § 1300.03 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(d) A controlled substance prescription created using an electronic prescription application that meets the requirements of this subpart is not a valid prescription if any of the functions required under this subpart were disabled when the prescription was indicated as ready for signature and signed.
</P>
<P>(e) A registered pharmacy may process electronic prescriptions for controlled substances only if all of the following conditions are met:
</P>
<P>(1) The pharmacy uses a pharmacy application that meets all of the applicable requirements of this subpart; and
</P>
<P>(2) The prescription is otherwise in conformity with the requirements of the Act and this chapter.
</P>
<P>(f) Nothing in this part alters the responsibilities of the practitioner and pharmacy, specified in part 1306 of this chapter, to ensure the validity of a controlled substance prescription.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="1311.102" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1311.102   Practitioner responsibilities.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The practitioner must retain sole possession of the hard token, where applicable, and must not share the password or other knowledge factor, or biometric information, with any other person. The practitioner must not allow any other person to use the token or enter the knowledge factor or other identification means to sign prescriptions for controlled substances. Failure by the practitioner to secure the hard token, knowledge factor, or biometric information may provide a basis for revocation or suspension of registration pursuant to section 304(a)(4) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4)).
</P>
<P>(b) The practitioner must notify the individuals designated under § 1311.125 or § 1311.130 within one business day of discovery that the hard token has been lost, stolen, or compromised or the authentication protocol has been otherwise compromised. A practitioner who fails to comply with this provision may be held responsible for any controlled substance prescriptions written using his two-factor authentication credential.
</P>
<P>(c) If the practitioner is notified by an intermediary or pharmacy that an electronic prescription was not successfully delivered, as provided in § 1311.170, he must ensure that any paper or oral prescription (where permitted) issued as a replacement of the original electronic prescription indicates that the prescription was originally transmitted electronically to a particular pharmacy and that the transmission failed.
</P>
<P>(d) Before initially using an electronic prescription application to sign and transmit controlled substance prescriptions, the practitioner must determine that the third-party auditor or certification organization has found that the electronic prescription application records, stores, and transmits the following accurately and consistently:
</P>
<P>(1) The information required for a prescription under § 1306.05(a) of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(2) The indication of signing as required by § 1311.120(b)(17) or the digital signature created by the practitioner's private key.
</P>
<P>(3) The number of refills as required by § 1306.22 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(e) If the third-party auditor or certification organization has found that an electronic prescription application does not accurately and consistently record, store, and transmit other information required for prescriptions under this chapter, the practitioner must not create, sign, and transmit electronic prescriptions for controlled substances that are subject to the additional information requirements.
</P>
<P>(f) The practitioner must not use the electronic prescription application to sign and transmit electronic controlled substance prescriptions if any of the functions of the application required by this subpart have been disabled or appear to be functioning improperly.
</P>
<P>(g) If an electronic prescription application provider notifies an individual practitioner that a third-party audit or certification report indicates that the application or the application provider no longer meets the requirements of this part or notifies him that the application provider has identified an issue that makes the application non-compliant, the practitioner must do the following:
</P>
<P>(1) Immediately cease to issue electronic controlled substance prescriptions using the application.
</P>
<P>(2) Ensure, for an installed electronic prescription application at an individual practitioner's practice, that the individuals designated under § 1311.125 terminate access for signing controlled substance prescriptions.
</P>
<P>(h) If an electronic prescription application provider notifies an institutional practitioner that a third-party audit or certification report indicates that the application or the application provider no longer meets the requirements of this part or notifies it that the application provider has identified an issue that makes the application non-compliant, the institutional practitioner must ensure that the individuals designated under § 1311.130 terminate access for signing controlled substance prescriptions.
</P>
<P>(i) An individual practitioner or institutional practitioner that receives a notification that the electronic prescription application is not in compliance with the requirements of this part must not use the application to issue electronic controlled substance prescriptions until it is notified that the application is again compliant and all relevant updates to the application have been installed.
</P>
<P>(j) The practitioner must notify both the individuals designated under § 1311.125 or § 1311.130 and the Administration within one business day of discovery that one or more prescriptions that were issued under a DEA registration held by that practitioner were prescriptions the practitioner had not signed or were not consistent with the prescriptions he signed.
</P>
<P>(k) The practitioner has the same responsibilities when issuing prescriptions for controlled substances via electronic means as when issuing a paper or oral prescription. Nothing in this subpart relieves a practitioner of his responsibility to dispense controlled substances only for a legitimate medical purpose while acting in the usual course of his professional practice. If an agent enters information at the practitioner's direction prior to the practitioner reviewing and approving the information and signing and authorizing the transmission of that information, the practitioner is responsible in case the prescription does not conform in all essential respects to the law and regulations.

<DIV8 N="1311.200" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1311.200   Pharmacy responsibilities.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Before initially using a pharmacy application to process controlled substance prescriptions, the pharmacy must determine that the third-party auditor or certification organization has found that the pharmacy application does the following accurately and consistently:
</P>
<P>(1) Import, store, and display the information required for prescriptions under § 1306.05(a) of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(2) Import, store, and display the indication of signing as required by § 1311.120(b)(17).
</P>
<P>(3) Import, store, and display the number of refills as required by § 1306.22 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(4) Import, store, and verify the practitioner's digital signature, as provided in § 1311.210(c), where applicable.
</P>
<P>(b) If the third-party auditor or certification organization has found that a pharmacy application does not accurately and consistently import, store, and display other information required for prescriptions under this chapter, the pharmacy must not process electronic prescriptions for controlled substances that are subject to the additional information requirements.
</P>
<P>(c) If a pharmacy application provider notifies a pharmacy that a third-party audit or certification report indicates that the application or the application provider no longer meets the requirements of this part or notifies it that the application provider has identified an issue that makes the application non-compliant, the pharmacy must immediately cease to process controlled substance prescriptions using the application.
</P>
<P>(d) A pharmacy that receives a notification that the pharmacy application is not in compliance with the requirements of this part must not use the application to process controlled substance prescriptions until it is notified that the application is again compliant and all relevant updates to the application have been installed.
</P>
<P>(e) The pharmacy must determine which employees are authorized to enter information regarding the dispensing of controlled substance prescriptions and annotate or alter records of these prescriptions (to the extent such alterations are permitted under this chapter). The pharmacy must ensure that logical access controls in the pharmacy application are set so that only such employees are granted access to perform these functions.
</P>
<P>(f) When a pharmacist fills a prescription in a manner that would require, under part 1306 of this chapter, the pharmacist to make a notation on the prescription if the prescription were a paper prescription, the pharmacist must make the same notation electronically when filling an electronic prescription and retain the annotation electronically in the prescription record or in linked files. When a prescription is received electronically, the prescription and all required annotations must be retained electronically.
</P>
<P>(g) When a pharmacist receives a paper or oral prescription that indicates that it was originally transmitted electronically to the pharmacy, the pharmacist must check its records to ensure that the electronic version was not received and the prescription dispensed. If both prescriptions were received, the pharmacist must mark one as void.
</P>
<P>(h) When a pharmacist receives a paper or oral prescription that indicates that it was originally transmitted electronically to another pharmacy, the pharmacist must check with that pharmacy to determine whether the prescription was received and dispensed. If the pharmacy that received the original electronic prescription had not dispensed the prescription, that pharmacy must mark the electronic version as void or canceled. If the pharmacy that received the original electronic prescription dispensed the prescription, the pharmacy with the paper version must not dispense the paper prescription and must mark the prescription as void.
</P>
<P>(i) Nothing in this part relieves a pharmacy and pharmacist of the responsibility to dispense controlled substances only pursuant to a prescription issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a practitioner acting in the usual course of professional practice.

<HEAD>§ 1312.12   Application for import permit; return information.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Registered importers, other registrants authorized to import as a coincident activity of their registrations, and persons who in accordance with part 1301 of this chapter are exempt from registration, seeking to import a controlled substance in schedule I or II; any narcotic drug in schedule III, IV, or V; any non-narcotic drug in schedule III that has been specifically designated by regulation in § 1312.30; or any non-narcotic substance listed in schedule IV or V that is also listed in schedule I or II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971, must submit an application for a permit to import controlled substances on DEA Form 357. All applications and supporting materials must be submitted to the Administration through the DEA Diversion Control Division secure network application. The application must be signed and dated by the importer and must contain the importer's registered address to which the controlled substances will be imported.
</P>
<P>(b) The applicant must include on the DEA Form 357 the registration number of the importer and a detailed description of each controlled substance to be imported including the drug name, dosage form, National Drug Code (NDC) number, the Administration Controlled Substance Code Number as set forth in part 1308 of this chapter, the number and size of the packages or containers, the name and quantity of the controlled substance contained in any finished dosage units, and the quantity of any controlled substance (expressed in anhydrous acid, base or alkaloid) given in kilograms or parts thereof. The application must also include the following:
</P>
<P>(1) The name/business name, address/business address, contact information (<I>e.g.,</I> telephone number(s), email address(es), etc.), and business of the consignor, if known at the time the application is submitted, but if unknown at that time, the fact should be indicated and the name and address afterwards furnished to the Administration as soon as ascertained by the importer;
</P>
<P>(2) The foreign port and country of initial exportation (<I>i.e.,</I> the place where the article will begin its journey of exportation to the United States);
</P>
<P>(3) The port of entry into the United States;
</P>
<P>(4) The latest date said shipment will leave said foreign port or country;
</P>
<P>(5) The stock on hand of the controlled substance desired to be imported;
</P>
<P>(6) The name of the importing carrier or vessel (if known), or if unknown it should be stated whether the shipment will be made by express, freight, or otherwise, imports of controlled substances in Schedules I or II and narcotic drugs in Schedules III, IV, or V by mail being prohibited);
</P>
<P>(7) The total tentative allotment to the importer of such controlled substance for the current calendar year; and
</P>
<P>(8) The total number of kilograms of said allotment for which permits have previously been issued and the total quantity of controlled substance actually imported during the current year to date.
</P>
<P>(c) If desired, alternative foreign ports of exportation within the same country may be indicated upon the application (<I>e.g.,</I> 1. Kolkata, 2. Mumbai). If a permit is issued pursuant to such application, it will bear the names of the two ports in the order given in the application and will authorize shipment from either port. Alternative ports in different countries will not be authorized in the same permit.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Return information.</I> Within 30 calendar days after actual receipt of a controlled substance at the importer's registered location, or within 10 calendar days after receipt of a written request by the Administration to the importer, whichever is sooner, the importer must file a report with the Administration through the DEA Diversion Control Division secure network application specifying the particulars of the transaction. This report must include the following information: The date the controlled substance was released by a customs officer at the port of entry; the date on which the controlled substance arrived at the registered location; the actual quantity of the controlled substance released by a customs officer at the port of entry; and the actual quantity of the controlled substance that arrived at the registered location. Upon receipt and review, the Administration will assign a transaction identification number to a completed report. The report will not be deemed filed until the Administration has issued a transaction identification number.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Denied release at the port of entry.</I> In the event that a shipment of controlled substances has been denied release by a customs officer at the port of entry for any reason, the importer who attempted to have the shipment released must, within 5 business days of the denial, report to the Administration that the shipment was denied and the reason for denial. Such report must be transmitted to the Administration through the DEA Diversion Control Division secure network application. This report must include the following information: The quantity of the controlled substance denied release; the date on which release was denied; and the basis for the denied release. Upon the importer's report of a denied release at the port of entry, the DEA will assign the report a transaction identification number and the import permit will be void and of no effect. No shipment of controlled substances denied release for any reason will be allowed to be released into the United States unless the importer submits a new DEA Form 357 and the Administration issues a new import permit.

<HEAD>§ 1312.13   Issuance of import permit.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Administrator may authorize importation of any controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II or any narcotic drug listed in Schedule III, IV, or V if he finds: 
</P>
<P>(1) That the substance is crude opium, poppy straw, concentrate of poppy straw, or coca leaves, in such quantity as the Administrator finds necessary to provide for medical, scientific, or other legitimate purposes; 
</P>
<P>(2) That the substance is necessary to provide for medical and scientific needs or other legitimate needs of the United States during an emergency where domestic supplies of such substance or drug are found to be inadequate, or in any case in which the Administrator finds that competition among domestic manufacturers of the controlled substance is inadequate and will not be rendered adequate by the registration of additional manufacturers under section 303 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 823); or 
</P>
<P>(3) That the domestic supply of any controlled substance is inadequate for scientific studies, and that the importation of that substance for scientific purposes is only for delivery to officials of the United Nations, of the United States, or of any State, or to any person registered or exempted from registration under sections 1007 and 1008 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 957 and 958). 
</P>
<P>(4) That the importation of the controlled substance is for ballistics or other analytical or scientific purposes, and that the importation of that substance is only for delivery to officials of the United Nations, of the United States, or of any State, or to any person registered or exempted from registration under sections 1007 and 1008 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 957 and 958). 
</P>
<P>(b) The Administrator may require that such non-narcotic controlled substances in Schedule III as he shall designate by regulation in § 1312.30 of this part be imported only pursuant to the issuance of an import permit. The Administrator may authorize the importation of such substances if he finds that the substance is being imported for medical, scientific or other legitimate uses. 
</P>
<P>(c) If a non-narcotic substance listed in Schedule IV or V is also listed in Schedule I or II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971, it shall be imported only pursuant to the issuance of an import permit. The Administrator may authorize the importation of such substances if it is found that the substance is being imported for medical, scientific or other legitimate uses. 
</P>
<P>(d) The Administrator may require an applicant to submit such documents or written statements of fact relevant to the application as he deems necessary to determine whether the application should be granted. The failure of the applicant to provide such documents or statements within a reasonable time after being requested to do so shall be deemed to be a waiver by the applicant of an opportunity to present such documents or facts for consideration by the Administrator in granting or denying the application. 
</P>
<P>(e) If an importation is approved, the Administrator will issue an import permit bearing his or her signature or that of his or her delegate. Each permit will be assigned a unique permit number. A permit must not be altered or changed by any person after being signed. Any change or alteration upon the face of any permit after it has been signed renders it void and of no effect. Permits are not transferable. The Administrator or his/her delegate will date and certify on each permit that the importer named therein is thereby permitted as a registrant under the Act, to import, through the port of entry named, one shipment of not to exceed the specified quantity of the named controlled substances, shipment to be made before a specified date. Only one shipment may be made on a single import permit. A single import permit shall authorize a quantity of goods to be imported/exported at one place, at one time, for delivery to one consignee, on a single conveyance, at one place, on one bill of lading, air waybill, or commercial loading document; a single permit shall not authorize a quantity of goods to be imported/exported if the goods are divided onto two or more conveyances. The permit must state that the Administration is satisfied that the consignment proposed to be imported is required for legitimate purposes.
</P>
<P>(f) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, the Administrator shall permit, pursuant to section 1002(a)(1) or 1002(a)(2)(A) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 952(a)(1) or (a)(2)(A)), the importation of approved narcotic raw material (opium, poppy straw and concentrate of poppy straw) having as its source:
</P>
<P>(1) Turkey,
</P>
<P>(2) India,
</P>
<P>(3) Spain,
</P>
<P>(4) France,
</P>
<P>(5) Poland,
</P>
<P>(6) Hungary, and
</P>
<P>(7) Australia.
</P>
<P>(g) At least eighty (80) percent of the narcotic raw material imported into the United States shall have as its original source Turkey and India. Except under conditions of insufficient supplies of narcotic raw materials, not more than twenty (20) percent of the narcotic raw material imported into the United States annually shall have as its source Spain, France, Poland, Hungary and Australia.

<HEAD>§ 1312.16   Amendment, cancellation, expiration of import permit.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Importers may only request that an import permit or application for an import permit be amended in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section. Requests for an amendment must be submitted through the DEA Diversion Control Division secure network application. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section and § 1312.15(a), importers must submit all requests for an amendment at least one full business day in advance of the date of release by a customs officer. Importers must specifically request that an amendment be made; supplementary information submitted by an importer through the DEA Diversion Control Division secure network application will not automatically trigger the amendment process. While the request for an amendment is being reviewed by the Administration, the original permit will be temporarily stayed and may not be used to authorize entry of a shipment of controlled substances. If the importer's request for an amendment to an issued permit is granted by the Administration, the Administration will immediately cancel the original permit and re-issue the permit, as amended, with a revised permit number. The DEA and importer will distribute the amended permit in accordance with § 1312.14. If a request for an amendment is denied by the Administration, the temporary stay will be lifted; once lifted, the originally issued permit may immediately be used to authorize entry of a shipment in accordance with the terms of the permit, subject to the shipment being compliant with all other applicable laws.
</P>
<P>(1) An importer may request that an import permit or application for a permit be amended to change the National Drug Control number, description of the packaging, or trade name of the product, so long as the description is for the same basic class of controlled substance as in the original permit.
</P>
<P>(2) An importer may request that an import permit or application for a permit be amended to change the proposed port of entry, the date of release by a customs officer, or the method of transport.
</P>
<P>(3) An importer may request that an import permit or application for a permit be amended to change the justification provided as to why an import shipment is needed to meet the legitimate scientific or medical needs of the United States.
</P>
<P>(4) An importer may request that an import permit or application for a permit be amended to change any registrant notes.
</P>
<P>(5) Prior to departure of the shipment from its original foreign location, an importer may request that an import permit or application for a permit be amended to increase the total base weight of a controlled substance. At the U.S. port of entry, an importer may request that an import permit be amended in accordance with § 1312.15(a). Importers are not required to amend an import permit for the sole purpose of decreasing the total base weight of a controlled substance authorized to be imported. However, the balance of any unimported authorized quantity of controlled substances on an import permit is void upon entry of a shipment on the issued permit or upon expiration of the unused permit in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, whichever is sooner. Other than for an amendment to an import permit under § 1312.15(a), importers must submit a request for an amendment to increase the total base weight of a controlled substance at least three business days in advance of the date of release by a customs officer.
</P>
<P>(6) An importer may request that an import permit be amended to remove a controlled substance from the permit. However, an importer may not amend an import permit to add or replace a controlled substance/Administration controlled substance code number to the item(s) to be imported. Importers who desire to import a different controlled substance than that contained on their issued import permit or permit application must submit a request for the permit or permit application to be canceled and request a new permit in accordance with § 1312.12.
</P>
<P>(7) An importer may not amend the importer's name (as it appears on their DEA certificate of registration) or the name of the foreign exporter as provided in the DEA Form 357. Importers who need to make any changes to any of these fields must submit a request for the permit or permit application to be canceled and request a new permit in accordance with § 1312.12.
</P>
<P>(b) An import permit will be void and of no effect after the expiration date specified therein, and in no event will the date be more than 180 calendar days after the date the permit is issued. Amended import permits will retain the original expiration date.
</P>
<P>(c) An import permit may be canceled after being issued, at the request of the importer submitted to the Administration through the DEA Diversion Control Division secure network application, provided that no shipment has been made thereunder.
</P>
<P>Nothing in this part will affect the right, hereby reserved by the Administration, to cancel a permit at any time for proper cause.

While the amendment is being processed by the Administration, the original declaration will be temporarily stayed and may not be used to authorize release of a shipment of controlled substances. Upon receipt and review, the Administration will assign each completed amendment a transaction identification number. The amendment will not be deemed filed until the Administration issues a transaction identification number. The DEA and importer will distribute the amended declaration in accordance with § 1312.19.

All applications and supporting materials must be submitted to the Administration through the DEA Diversion Control Division secure network application. The application must be signed and dated by the exporter and contain the exporter's registered address from which the controlled substances will be exported. Controlled substances may not be exported until a permit number has been issued.
</P>
<P>(b) Exports of controlled substances by mail are prohibited.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Applications.</I> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, each application for a permit to export or reexport must include the following information:

In determining whether the exporter has complied with the requirement to file within 30 calendar days, the report shall be deemed filed on the first date on which a complete report is filed.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Return information for export from a first country that is or is not a member of the European Economic Area to a country outside of the European Economic Area; return information for export from a first country that is not a member of the European Economic Area to a member of the European Economic Area.</I> Within 30 calendar days after the controlled substance is exported from the first country to the second country the exporter must file a report with the Administration through the DEA Diversion Control Division secure network application specifying the particulars of the export from the first country.

</P>
<P>(1) Bulk substances will not be reexported in the same form as exported from the United States, <I>i.e.,</I> the material must undergo further manufacturing process. This further manufactured material may only be reexported to a second country.
</P>
<P>(2) Finished dosage units, if reexported, must be in a commercial package, properly sealed and labeled for legitimate medical use in the second country.
</P>
<P>(3) Any proposed reexportation must be made known to the Administration at the time the initial DEA Form 161R is submitted. In addition, the following information must also be provided where indicated on the form:

</P>
<P>(4) The application must contain an affidavit that the consignee in the second country, and any country of subsequent reexport within the European Economic Area, is authorized under the laws and regulations of the second and/or subsequent country to receive the controlled substances. The affidavit must also contain the following statements, in addition to the statements required under paragraph (c) of this section:
</P>
<P>(i) That the packages are labeled in conformance with the obligations of the United States under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971, and any amendments to such treaties in effect;

</P>
<P>(6) Except in the case of reexports among countries of the European Economic Area in accordance with section 1003(f) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 953(f)), the controlled substance will be reexported from the first country to the second country (or second countries) no later than 180 calendar days after the controlled substance was released by a customs officer from the United States.
</P>
<P>(7) Shipments that have been exported from the United States and are refused by the consignee in either the first or second country, or subsequent member of the European Economic Area, or are otherwise unacceptable or undeliverable, may be returned to the registered exporter in the United States upon authorization of the Administration. In these circumstances, the exporter in the United States must submit a written request for the return of the controlled substances to the United States with a brief summary of the facts that warrant the return, along with a completed DEA Form 357 through the DEA Diversion Control Division secure network application. The Administration will evaluate the request after considering all the facts as well as the exporter's registration status with the Administration. If the exporter provides sufficient justification, the Administration may issue an import permit for the return of these drugs, and the exporter may then obtain an export permit from the country of original importation. The substance may not be returned to the United States until after a permit has been issued by the Administration.
</P>
<P>(i) In considering whether to grant an application for a permit under paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section, the Administration shall consider whether the applicant has previously obtained such a permit and, if so, whether the applicant complied fully with the requirements of this section with respect to that previous permit.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Denied release at the port of export.</I> In the event that a shipment of controlled substances has been denied release by a customs officer at the port export from the United States for any reason, the exporter who attempted to have the shipment released must, within 5 business days of the denial, report to the Administration that the shipment was denied release and the reason for denial. Such report must be transmitted to the Administration through the DEA Diversion Control Division secure network application. This report must include the following information: The quantity of the controlled substance denied release; the date on which release was denied; the basis for the denied release, the port from which the denial was issued, and any other information as the Administration may from time to time specify. Upon the exporter's report of a denied release, DEA will assign the report a transaction identification number and the export permit will be void and of no effect. No shipment of controlled substances denied release for any reason will be allowed to be released from the United States unless the exporter submits a new DEA Form 161, 161R, or 161R-EEA, as appropriate, and the Administration issues a new export permit.

<HEAD>§ 1312.23   Issuance of export permit.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Administrator may authorize exportation of any controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II or any narcotic controlled substance listed in Schedule III or IV if he finds that such exportation is permitted by subsections 1003(a), (b), (c), (d), or (f) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 953(a), (b), (c), (d), or (f).

<P>(b) The Administrator may require that such non-narcotic controlled substances in Schedule III as shall be designated by regulation in § 1312.30 of this part be exported only pursuant to the issuance of an export permit. The Administrator may authorize the exportation of such substances if he finds that such exportation is permitted by section 1003(e) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 953(e)). 
</P>
<P>(c) If a non-narcotic substance listed in Schedule IV or V is also listed in Schedule I or II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, it shall be exported only pursuant to the issuance of an export permit. The Administrator may authorize the exportation of such substances if he finds that such exportation is permitted by section 1003(e) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 953(e)). 
</P>
<P>(d) The Administrator may require an applicant to submit such documents or written statements of fact relevant to the application as he deems necessary to determine whether the application should be granted. The failure of the applicant to provide such documents or statements within a reasonable time after being requested to do so shall be deemed to be a waiver by the applicant of an opportunity to present such documents or facts for consideration by the Administrator in granting or denying the application. 
</P>
<P>(e) If an exportation is approved, the Administrator shall issue an export permit bearing his or her signature or that of his or her delegate. Each permit will be assigned a permit number that is a unique, randomly generated identifier. A permit shall not be altered or changed by any person after being signed. Any change or alteration upon the face of any permit after it has been signed renders it void and of no effect. Permits are not transferable. The Administrator or his/her delegate shall date and certify on each permit that the exporter named therein is thereby permitted as a registrant under the Act, to export, through the port of export named, one shipment of not to exceed the specified quantity of the named controlled substances, shipment to be made before a specified date. Only one shipment may be made on a single export permit. A single export permit shall authorize a quantity of goods to be exported at one place, at one time, for delivery to one consignee, on a single conveyance, at one place, on one bill of lading, air waybill, or commercial loading document; a single permit shall not authorize a quantity of goods to be exported if the goods are divided onto two or more conveyances. Each export permit shall be predicated upon, <I>inter alia,</I> an import certificate or other documentary evidence issued by a foreign competent national authority.
</P>
<P>(f) No export permit shall be issued for the exportation, or reexportation, of any controlled substance to any country when the Administration has information to show that the estimates or assessments submitted with respect to that country for the current period, under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, or the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971, have been, or, considering the quantity proposed to be imported, will be exceeded. If it shall appear through subsequent advice received from the International Narcotics Control Board of the United Nations that the estimates or assessments of the country of destination have been adjusted to permit further importation of the controlled substance, an export permit may then be issued if otherwise permissible.

<HEAD>§ 1312.25   Amendment, cancellation, expiration of export permit.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Exporters may only request that an export permit or application for an export permit be amended in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section. Requests for an amendment must be submitted through the DEA Diversion Control Division secure network application. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section exporters must submit all requests for an amendment at least one full business day in advance of the date of release from the port of export. Exporters must specifically request that an amendment be made; supplementary information submitted by an exporter through the DEA Diversion Control Division secure network application will not automatically trigger the amendment process. While the request for an amendment is being reviewed by the Administration, the original permit will be temporarily stayed and may not be used to authorize release of a shipment of controlled substances. If the exporter's request for an amendment to an issued permit is granted by the Administration, the Administration will immediately cancel the original permit and re-issue the permit, as amended, with a revised permit number. The DEA and exporter will distribute the amended permit in accordance with § 1312.24. If a request for an amendment is denied by the Administration, the temporary stay will be lifted; once lifted, the originally issued permit may immediately be used to authorize release of a shipment in accordance with the terms of the permit.
</P>
<P>(1) An exporter may request that an export permit or application for a permit be amended to change the National Drug Control number, description of the packaging, or trade name of the product, so long as the description is for the same basic class of controlled substance as in the original permit.
</P>
<P>(2) An exporter may request that an export permit or application for a permit be amended to change the proposed port of export, the anticipated date of release by a customs officer, or the method of transport.
</P>
<P>(3) An exporter may request that an export permit or application for a permit be amended to change the justification provided as to why an export shipment is needed to meet the legitimate scientific or medical needs of the country of import.
</P>
<P>(4) An exporter may request that an export permit or application for a permit be amended to change any registrant notes.
</P>
<P>(5) Prior to departure of the shipment from the exporter's registered location, an exporter may request that an export permit or application for a permit be amended to increase the total base weight of a controlled substance. However, the total base weight or the strength of the product (if listed) of a controlled substance may not exceed that permitted for import as indicated on the import permit from the foreign competent national authority. Exporters are not required to amend an export permit for the sole purpose of decreasing the total base weight of a controlled substance authorized to be exported. However, the balance of any unexported authorized quantity of controlled substances on an export permit is void upon release of a shipment on the issued permit or upon expiration of the unused permit in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, whichever is sooner. Exporters must submit a request for an amendment to increase the total base weight of a controlled substance at least three business days in advance of the date of release from the port of export.
</P>
<P>(6) An exporter may request that an export permit be amended to remove a controlled substance from the permit. However, an exporter may not amend an export permit to add or replace a controlled substance to the item(s) to be exported. Exporters who desire to export a different controlled substance than that contained on their issued export permit or permit application must submit a request for the permit or permit application to be canceled and request a new permit in accordance with § 1312.22.
</P>
<P>(7) An exporter may not amend the exporter's name (as it appears on their DEA certificate of registration), the name of the foreign importer(s), or the foreign permit information as provided in the DEA Form 161, 161R, or 161R-EEA. Exporters who need to make any changes to any of these fields must submit a request for the permit or permit application to be canceled and request a new permit in accordance with § 1312.22.
</P>

</P>
<P>(b) The regulated seller must not sell a scheduled listed chemical product at retail unless the sale is made in accordance with the following:
</P>
<P>(1) The purchaser presents an identification card that provides a photograph and is issued by a State or the Federal Government, or a document that, with respect to identification, is considered acceptable for purposes of 8 CFR 274a.2(b)(1)(v)(A) and 274a.2(b)(1)(v)(B).
</P>
<P>(2) The purchaser signs the logbook as follows:

<P>(B) Signing a bound paper book.
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) The bound paper book must include, for such purchaser, either—
</P>
<P>(<I>i</I>) A printed sticker affixed to the bound paper book at the time of sale that either displays the name of each product sold, the quantity sold, the name and address of the purchaser, and the date and time of the sale, or a unique identifier which can be linked to that electronic information, or
</P>
<P>(<I>ii</I>) A unique identifier that can be linked to that information and that is written into the book by the seller at the time of sale.
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) The purchaser must sign adjacent to the printed sticker or written unique identifier related to that sale. The bound paper book must display the warning notice in paragraph (d) of this section.

Each signed document must be inserted into a binder or other secure means of document storage immediately after the purchaser signs the document.
</P>
<P>(3) The regulated seller must enter in the logbook the name of the product and the quantity sold. Examples of methods of recording the quantity sold include the weight of the product per package and number of packages of each chemical, the cumulative weight of the product for each chemical, or quantity of product by Universal Product Code. These examples do not exclude other methods of displaying the quantity sold. Such information may be captured through electronic means, including through electronic data capture through bar code reader or similar technology. Such electronic records must be provided pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section in a human readable form such that the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are satisfied.

<HEAD>§ 1315.07   Subcategories of manufacturing and procurement quota.</HEAD>
<P>The five subcategories are:
</P>
<P>(a) Quota for Commercial Sale is a quota for the amount of bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) initially acquired by a registrant for the manufacture of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine products and bulk API acquired by outsourcing facilities, manufacturers, etc. This type of quota shall only be used to support commercial manufacturing efforts and shall not be used to support other manufacturing efforts.
</P>
<P>(b) Quota for Transfer is a quota for the amount of material moved from one registrant to another and does not include material captured under procurement quota for commercial sale. Examples include: 1. Bulk API being transferred back to the original registrant after milling; 2. Transfer of in-process material or finished dosage-forms for additional manufacturing efforts (coating, beading, encapsulation, and so forth) back to the preceding registrant; and 3. Return of material after the specified manufacturing activity has been completed.
</P>
<P>(c) Quota for Product Development is a quota for the amount of material needed for product development and validation manufacturing efforts. This quota is limited to that activity <I>only</I> and only for the development efforts noted in the application; it shall not be used or substituted for commercial production or the development of a different product. This quota is issued with the understanding that this material is not intended for commercial use, with the exception of FDA-approved or OTC Monograph validation batches. Validation batches shall be noted specifically in an application and shall be considered product development material that will be taken into account once a product is FDA-approved for commercial sale. No inventory shall be granted for these efforts, nor shall replacement quota be considered for destroyed material issued under this quota subcategory.
</P>
<P>(d) Quota for Replacement is a type of individual manufacturing quota or procurement quota that is granted to a registrant after the registrant disposes of material that was initially intended for commercial sale, but for some reason was unable to be marketed. This quota is separate and shall not count against a registrant's other issued quota. Replacement quota will be granted on a case by case basis. The merits of the request shall be determined by the registrant's justification. Replacement quota is intended to replace material from the current quota year and shall not be used to replace disposed samples, analytical samples, product development material or inventory acquired under previous quota years.
</P>
<P>(e) Quota for Packaging/Repackaging and Labeling/Relabeling is quota for the amount of material moved to a registrant to undergo packaging and labeling activities. This quota is limited to that activity <I>only</I> and only for the packaging/repackaging and labeling/relabeling noted in the application; it shall not be used or substituted for commercial production or the packaging of a different product.

<P>(a) For the purpose of determining procurement quotas pursuant to § 1315.32, each registered manufacturer shall be allowed as part of such quota an amount sufficient to maintain an inventory:
</P>
<P>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for current manufacturers, 35 percent of his average estimated net disposal for the current calendar year and the last preceding calendar year; or
</P>
<P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, for new manufacturers, 35 percent of his reasonably estimated net disposal for the next calendar year as determined by the Administrator.
</P>
<P>(3) For current liquid injectable dosage-form manufacturers, 50 percent of his average estimated net disposal for the current calendar year and the last preceding calendar year; or
</P>
<P>(4) For new liquid injectable dosage-form manufacturers, 50 percent of his reasonably estimated net disposal for the next calendar year as determined by the Administrator.
</P>
<P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, during each calendar year, each registered manufacturer receiving a procurement quota shall be allowed to maintain an inventory of a chemical not exceeding 50 percent of his estimated net disposal of that chemical for that year, as determined at the time his quota for that year was determined. At any time the inventory of a chemical held by a manufacturer exceeds 50 percent of his estimated net disposal, his quota for that chemical is automatically suspended and shall remain suspended until his inventory is less than 45 percent of his estimated net disposal. The Administrator may, upon application and for good cause shown, permit a manufacturer whose quota is, or is likely to be, suspended pursuant to this paragraph to continue manufacturing and to accumulate an inventory in excess of 50 percent of his estimated net disposal, upon such conditions and within such limitations as the Administrator may find necessary or desirable.
</P>
<P>(c) For liquid-injectable dosage-forms, during each calendar year, each registered manufacturer receiving a procurement quota shall be allowed to maintain an inventory of a chemical not exceeding 65 percent of his estimated net disposal of that chemical for that year, as determined at the time his quota for that year was determined. At any time the inventory of a chemical held by a manufacturer exceeds 65 percent of his estimated net disposal, his quota for that chemical is automatically suspended and shall remain suspended until his inventory is less than 60 percent of his estimated net disposal. The Administrator may, upon application and for good cause shown, permit a manufacturer whose quota is, or is likely to be, suspended pursuant to this paragraph to continue manufacturing and to accumulate an inventory in excess of 65 percent of his estimated net disposal, upon such conditions and within such limitations as the Administrator may find necessary or desirable.
</P>
<P>(d) If, during a calendar year, a registrant has procured the entire quantity of a chemical allocated to him under an individual procurement quota, and his inventory of that chemical is less than 25 percent of his estimated net disposal of that class for that year, the Administrator may, upon application pursuant to § 1315.25, increase the quota of such registrant sufficiently to allow restoration of the inventory to 35 percent of the estimated net disposal for that year.
</P>
<P>(e) For liquid-injectable dosage-forms, if, during a calendar year, a registrant has procured the entire quantity of a chemical allocated to him under an individual procurement quota, and his inventory of that chemical is less than 40 percent of his estimated net disposal of that class for that year, the Administrator may, upon application pursuant to § 1315.25, increase the quota of such registrant sufficiently to allow restoration of the inventory to 50 percent of the estimated net disposal for that year.

<P>(a) As provided in section 303(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823(a)), the Administrator may grant an application for a registration to manufacture marihuana, including the cultivation of cannabis, only if he determines that such registration is consistent with the public interest and with United States obligations under the Single Convention.
</P>
<P>(b) In accordance with section 303(a) of the Act and §  1301.44(a) of this chapter, the burden shall be on the applicant to demonstrate that the requirements for such registration have been satisfied.

<DIV8 N="1318.04" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1318.04   Specific control measures applicable to the bulk manufacture of marihuana.</HEAD>
<P>For a registration to manufacture marihuana that involves the cultivation of cannabis, the following provisions must be satisfied:
</P>
<P>(a) All registered manufacturers who cultivate cannabis shall deliver their total crops of cannabis to the Administration, except as provided in paragraph (d). The Administration shall purchase and take physical possession of such crops as soon as possible, but not later than four months after the end of the harvest. The Administration may accept delivery and maintain possession of such crops at the registered location of the registered manufacturer authorized to cultivate cannabis consistent with the maintenance of effective controls against diversion. In such cases, the Administration shall designate a secure storage mechanism at the registered location in which the Administration may maintain possession of the cannabis, and the Administration will control access to the stored cannabis. If the Administration determines that no suitable location exists at the registered location of the registered manufacturer authorized to cultivate cannabis, then the Administration shall designate a location for the authorized grower to deliver the crop as soon as possible, but not later than four months after the end of the harvest. However, in all cases the registrant must comply with the security requirements specified in part 1301 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(b) The Administration shall, with respect to cannabis, have the exclusive right of importing, exporting, wholesale trading, and maintaining stocks other than those held by registered manufacturers and distributors of medicinal cannabis or cannabis preparations. Such exclusive right shall not extend to medicinal cannabis or cannabis preparations. The Administration may exercise its exclusive right by authorizing the performance of such activities by appropriately registered persons. The Administration shall require prior written notice of each proposed importation, exportation, or distribution of cannabis that specifies the quantity of cannabis to be imported, exported, or distributed and the name, address, and registration number of the registered manufacturer or researcher to receive the cannabis before authorizing the importation, exportation, or distribution. All importation and exportation shall be performed in compliance with part 1312 of this chapter, as applicable. Under no circumstance shall a registered manufacturer authorized to grow cannabis import, export, or distribute cannabis without the express written authorization of the Administration.
</P>
<P>(c) A registered manufacturer authorized to grow cannabis shall notify in writing the Administration of its proposed date of harvest at least 15 days before the commencement of the harvest.
</P>
<P>(d) A registered manufacturer authorized to grow cannabis may distribute small quantities of cannabis to a registered analytical lab for chemical analysis by such analytical lab prior to the Administration purchasing and taking physical possession of the crop. The cannabis delivered to the analytical lab under such circumstances need not be delivered to the Administration pursuant to paragraph (a), provided such cannabis is destroyed by the analytical lab upon completion of the testing. Any such distribution of cannabis by a registered manufacturer to a registered analytical lab must comply with all applicable requirements of the Act and this subchapter, including but not limited to security and recordkeeping requirements.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="1318.05" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1318.05   Application of the public interest factors.</HEAD>
<P>(a) In accordance with section 303(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823(a)), the Administrator shall consider the public interest factors set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section:
</P>
<P>(1) Maintenance of effective controls against diversion of particular controlled substances and any controlled substance in schedule I or II compounded therefrom into other than legitimate medical, scientific, research, or industrial channels, by limiting the importation and bulk manufacture of such controlled substances to a number of establishments which can produce an adequate and uninterrupted supply of these substances under adequately competitive conditions for legitimate medical, scientific, research, and industrial purposes;
</P>
<P>(2) Compliance with applicable State and local law;
</P>
<P>(3) Promotion of technical advances in the art of manufacturing these substances and the development of new substances;
</P>
<P>(4) Prior conviction record of applicant under Federal and State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of such substances;
</P>
<P>(5) Past experience in the manufacture of controlled substances, and the existence in the establishment of effective control against diversion; and
</P>
<P>(6) Such other factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety.
</P>
<P>(b) The Administrator's determination of which applicants to select will be consistent with the public interest factors set forth in section 303(a), with particular emphasis on the following criteria:
</P>
<P>(1) Whether the applicant has demonstrated prior compliance with the Act and this chapter;
</P>
<P>(2) The applicant's ability to consistently produce and supply cannabis of a high quality and defined chemical composition; and
</P>
<P>(3)(i) In determining under section 303(a)(1) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823(a)(1)) the number of qualified applicants necessary to produce an adequate and uninterrupted supply of cannabis under adequately competitive conditions, the Administrator shall place particular emphasis on the extent to which any applicant is able to supply cannabis or its derivatives in quantities and varieties that will satisfy the anticipated demand of researchers and other registrants in the United States who wish to obtain cannabis to conduct activities permissible under the Act, as demonstrated through a bona fide supply agreement with a registered researcher or manufacturer as defined in this subpart.
</P>
<P>(ii) If an applicant seeks registration to grow cannabis for its own research or product development, the applicant must possess registration as a schedule I researcher with respect to marihuana under §  1301.32 of this chapter. As specified in §  1301.13 of this chapter, chemical analysis and preclinical research (including quality control analysis) are not coincident activities of a manufacturing registration for schedule I substances, including cannabis. In determining under section 303(a)(1) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823(a)(1)) the number of qualified applicants necessary to produce an adequate and uninterrupted supply of cannabis under adequately competitive conditions, the Administrator shall consider the holding of an approved marihuana research protocol by a registered schedule I researcher seeking to grow cannabis for its own research or product development as evidence of the necessity of the applicant's registration under this factor.
</P>
<P>(c) Applications accepted for filing after January 19, 2021 will not be considered pending for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section until all applications accepted for filing on or before January 19, 2021 have been granted or denied by the Administrator. Where an application is subject to section 303(i) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823(i)), that section shall apply in lieu of this paragraph (c).
</P>
<P>(d) In determining the legitimate demand for cannabis and its derivatives in the United States, the Administrator shall consult with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including its components.

<DIV8 N="1318.06" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1318.06   Factors affecting prices for the purchase and sale by the Administration of cannabis.</HEAD>
<P>(a) In accordance with section 111(b)(3) of Public Law 102-395 (21 U.S.C. 886a(1)(C)), seeking to recover the full costs of operating the aspects of the diversion control program that are related to issuing registrations that comply with the Controlled Substances Act, the Administration shall assess an administrative fee. To set the administrative fee, the Administration shall annually determine the preceding fiscal year's cost of operating the program to cultivate cannabis and shall divide the prior fiscal year's cost by the number of kgs of cannabis authorized to be manufactured in the current year's quota to arrive at the administrative fee per kg. The administrative fee per kg shall be added to the sale price of cannabis purchased from the Administration. The administrative fee shall be paid to the Diversion Control Fee Account.
</P>
<P>(b) As set forth in §  1318.04, the Administration shall have the exclusive right of, among other things, wholesale trading in cannabis that it purchases from registered manufacturers. The Administration will, therefore, buy from such manufacturer, sell cannabis to registered researchers and manufacturers, and establish prices for such purchase and sale. The Administration will set such prices in the following manner:
</P>
<P>(1) Bulk growers of cannabis shall negotiate directly with registered researchers and manufacturers authorized to handle cannabis to determine a sale price for their cannabis. Upon entering into a contract for the provision of bulk cannabis and prior to the exchange of cannabis, the parties shall pay to the Administration an administrative fee assessed based on the number of kgs to be supplied. The administrative fee shall not be recoverable in the event that delivery is rejected by the buyer.
</P>
<P>(2) The Administration shall sell the cannabis to the buyer at the negotiated sale price plus the administrative fee assessed on a per kg basis. Prior to the purchase of the cannabis by the Administration, the buyer shall pay the negotiated purchase price and administrative fee to the Administration. The Administration shall hold funds equal to the purchase price in escrow until the delivery of the cannabis by the grower to the Administration. The administrative fee shall not be recoverable in the event that delivery is rejected by the buyer.
</P>
<P>(3) After receiving the purchase price and administrative fee from the buyer, the Administration shall purchase the cannabis from the grower, on behalf of the buyer, at the negotiated sale price. The Administration shall retain the administrative fee. In the event the buyer fails to pay the purchase price and the administrative fee, the Administration shall have no obligation to purchase the crop and may order the grower to destroy the crop if the grower cannot find an alternative buyer within four months of harvest.
</P>
<P>(4) In instances where the grower of the cannabis is the same entity as the buyer of the cannabis, or a related or subsidiary entity, the entity may establish a nominal price for the purchase of the cannabis. The Administration shall then purchase the entity's cannabis at that price and sell the cannabis back to the entity, or a related or subsidiary entity, at the same price with the addition of the administrative fee.
</P>
<P>(c) Administrative fees set in accordance with this part will be made available, on an updated basis, on the Administration's website, no later than December 15th of the year preceding the year in which the administrative fee will be collected.
</P>
<P>(d) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from continuing to fund the acquisition of cannabis for use in research by paying, directly or indirectly, the purchase cost and administrative fee to the Administration.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="1318.07" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1318.07   Non-liability of Drug Enforcement Administration.</HEAD>
<P>The Administration shall have no liability with respect to the performance of any contractual terms agreed to by a grower and buyer of bulk cannabis, including but not limited to the quality of any cannabis delivered to a buyer. In the event that a buyer deems the delivered cannabis to be defective, the buyer's sole remedy for damages shall be against the grower and not the Administration.

<DIV8 N="1401.3" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.3   Definitions.</HEAD>
<P>For the purpose of this part, all the terms defined in the Freedom of Information Act apply.
</P>
<P><I>Commercial use request</I> is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. An agency's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information. Agencies will notify requesters of their placement in this category.
</P>
<P><I>Direct costs</I> means the expense actually expended to search, review, or duplicate in response to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include 116% of the salary of the employee performing work (<I>i.e.,</I> the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the actual costs incurred while operating equipment.
</P>
<P><I>Duplicate</I> means the process of making a copy of a document. Such copies may take the form of paper, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine-readable documentation.
</P>
<P><I>Educational institution</I> is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. Agency may seek verification from the requester that the request furthers scholarly research, and agency will advise requesters of their placement in this category.
</P>
<P><I>Fee waiver</I> means the waiver or reduction of processing fees if a requester can demonstrate that certain statutory standards are satisfied, including that the information is in the public interest and is not requested for a commercial interest.
</P>
<P><I>FOIA public liaison</I> means a supervisory agency FOIA official who assists in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and resolving disputes between the requester and ONDCP.
</P>
<P><I>Noncommercial scientific institution</I> is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use. Agency will advise requesters of their placement in this category.
</P>
<P><I>OGIS</I> means the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration. OGIS offers FOIA dispute resolution services, which is a voluntary process. If ONDCP agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, ONDCP will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P><I>Records</I> and any other terms used in this part in reference to information includes any information that would be an agency record subject to the requirements of this part when maintained in any format, including electronic format.
</P>
<P><I>Representative of the news media</I> is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or information that would be of interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, the Agency can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. The Agency will advise requesters of their placement in this category.
</P>
<P><I>Request</I> means a letter or other written communication seeking records or information under FOIA.
</P>
<P><I>Requester category</I> means one of the three categories that ONDCP will place requesters in for the purpose of determining whether a requester will be charged fees for search, review, and duplication. The categories are: commercial use requests; non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters; and all other requesters.
</P>
<P><I>Review</I> means the process of examining documents that are located during a search to determine if any portion should lawfully be withheld. It is the processing of determining disclosability. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 1401.18, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
</P>
<P><I>Search</I> means to review, manually or by automated means, agency records for the purpose of locating those records responsive to a request.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="1401.4" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.4   Access to information.</HEAD>
<P>The Office of National Drug Control Policy makes available information pertaining to matters issued, adopted, or promulgated by ONDCP, that are within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). Such information is located at <I>https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp.</I> Included in that information are ONDCP's proactive disclosures. Proactive disclosures are records that have been requested three or more times, or that have been released to a requester and that ONDCP determines have become, or are likely to become, the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="1401.5" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.5   Records requiring consultation.</HEAD>
<P>Requests for records that are in ONDCP's custody but in which other agencies have equities shall be reviewed by ONDCP and then ONDCP will either consult with or refer the records to the other agency or agencies for further processing.
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Consultation.</I> When records originated with ONDCP, but contain within them information of interest to another agency or other Federal government office, ONDCP will consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Referral</I>—(1) <I>Determination.</I> When ONDCP believes that a different agency or component is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, ONDCP will refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if the agency processing the request and the originating agency jointly agree that the agency processing the request is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Documentation.</I> Whenever ONDCP refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it must document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Coordination.</I> The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. In order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the agency that received the request should coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by the agency that originally received the request.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Classified information.</I> On receipt of any request involving classified information, ONDCP must determine whether the information is currently and properly classified in accordance with applicable classification rules. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the receiving agency must refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever an agency's record contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another agency), the agency must refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Timing of responses to consultations and referrals.</I> All consultations and referrals received by ONDCP will be handled according to the date that the first agency received the perfected FOIA request.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Agreements regarding consultations and referrals.</I> ONDCP may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="1401.6" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.6   How to request records—form and content.</HEAD>
<P>(a) You must describe the records you seek in sufficient detail and in writing to enable ONDCP personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To satisfy this requirement, you should be as detailed as possible when describing the records you seek. To the extent possible, each request must reasonably describe the record(s) sought including the type of document, specific event or action, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, date or time period, location, and all other pertinent data. Before or after submitting their requests, requesters may contact ONDCP's FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they seek and for assistance in describing the records. A list of Agency FOIA Public Liaisons is available at <I>https://www.foia.gov/#agency-search.</I>
</P>
<P>(b)(1) If you are making a request for records about yourself, you must comply with the verification of identity provision set forth in § 1401.21(f) of this part.
</P>
<P>(2) If a request for records pertains to a third party, you may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or an unsworn declaration under 26 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to you. If the other individual is deceased, you should submit proof of death such as a copy of the death certificate or an obituary. As an exercise of administrative discretion, ONDCP may require you to provide additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.
</P>
<P>(c) Requesters may specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records they seek. ONDCP will try to accommodate formatting requests if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.
</P>
<P>(d) Whenever it is appropriate to do so, ONDCP automatically processes a Privacy Act request for access to records under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA, following the rules contained in this part. ONDCP processes a request under both the FOIA and Privacy Act so you will receive the maximum amount of information available to you by law.
</P>
<P>(e) Requests must be received by ONDCP through methods specified on the FOIA page of ONDCP's website: <I>https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/about/foia-and-legal/.</I> Requests may be emailed at any time to <I>FOIA@ondcp.eop.gov</I> or mailed to SSDMD/RDS; ONDCP Office of General Counsel; Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling (JBAB) Bldg. 410/Door 123; 250 Murray Lane SW, Washington, DC 20509. Email requests are strongly preferred.
</P>
<P>(f) The words “FOIA REQUEST” or “REQUEST FOR RECORDS” should be clearly marked on all FOIA request communications. The time limitations imposed by § 1401.7(a) will not begin until ONDCP identifies a communication as a FOIA request.
</P>
<P>(g) You must provide contact information, such as your phone number, email address and mailing address, so we will be able to communicate with you about your request and provide released records. If we cannot contact you, or you do not respond within 20 calendar days to our request for clarification, we will close your request.
</P>
<P>(h) To protect our computer systems, ONDCP reserves the right to not open attachments to emailed request. Please include your request within the body of your email.

<DIV8 N="1401.7" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.7   Responses—form and content.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Determinations.</I> The General Counsel, or designee, will determine within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of a FOIA request whether it is appropriate to grant the request and will provide written notification to the person making the request. The notification shall also advise the person making the request of any fees assessed under § 1401.11 through 13. ONDCP will inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Tracking number.</I> ONDCP will assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 working days to process and may assign such a tracking number for less than 10 working days at our discretion.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Adverse determinations.</I> If ONDCP makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it must notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: The requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Content of denial.</I> The denial must be signed by the head of the agency or designee and must include:
</P>
<P>(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;
</P>
<P>(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the agency in denying the request;
</P>
<P>(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and
</P>
<P>(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed to the Director or his/her designee within 90 days of the date of the response. The requirements for making an appeal are specified in § 1401.10.
</P>
<P>(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the agency's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="1401.8" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.8   Expedited process.</HEAD>
<P>(a) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. ONDCP must process requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:
</P>
<P>(1) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or
</P>
<P>(2) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally, and the request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information.
</P>
<P>(b) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person who is primarily engaged in information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. The formality of certification may be waived as a matter of administrative discretion.
</P>
<P>(c) Within 10 days of receipt of a request for expedited processing, ONDCP will decide whether to grant it and will notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, the request will be given priority and will be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision will be acted on expeditiously.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="1401.9" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.9   Extension of time.</HEAD>
<P>(a) In unusual circumstances, ONDCP may extend the time limit prescribed in § 1401.7(a), (b) or § 1401.8 by written notice to the FOIA requester. The notice will state the reasons for the extension.
</P>
<P>(b) The phrase “unusual circumstances” means:
</P>
<P>(1) The requested records are located in establishments that are separated from the office processing the request;
</P>
<P>(2) A voluminous amount of separate and distinct records are demanded in a single request; or
</P>
<P>(3) Another agency or two or more components in the same agency have substantial interest in the determination of the request.
</P>
<P>(c) Whenever ONDCP cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(b)(B), and ONDCP extends the time limit on that basis, the agency must, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which ONDCP estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, ONDCP must, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The Agency must make available its designated FOIA contact or its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. The Agency must also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services.
</P>
<P>(d) To satisfy unusual circumstances under the FOIA, ONDCP may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. ONDCP cannot aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="1401.10" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.10   Appeal procedures.</HEAD>
<P>(a) An appeal to the ONDCP must explain the reasoning and factual basis for the appeal. It must be received by email at <I>FOIA@ondcp.eop.gov</I> or another method specified on the FOIA page of ONDCP's website within 90 days of the date of the response. The appeal must be in writing, addressed to SSDMD/RDS; ONDCP Office of General Counsel; Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling (JBAB) Bldg. 410/Door 123; 250 Murray Lane SW, Washington, DC 20509. The communication should clearly be labeled as a “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”
</P>
<P>(b) The Director or designee will decide the appeal within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). If the Director or designee deny an appeal in whole or in part, the written determination will contain the reason for the denial, the name and title of the person responsible for the denial, any FOIA exemptions applied, and the provisions for judicial review of the denial and ruling on appeal provided in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). The denial will also inform the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS as a non-exclusive alternate to litigation. If ONDCP agrees to participate in voluntary dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage in an attempt to resolve the dispute.

<DIV8 N="1401.11" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.11   Fees to be charged—general.</HEAD>
<P>ONDCP will assess a fee to process FOIA requests in accordance with the provisions of this section and Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB Guidelines”). ONDCP shall ensure that searches, review and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. ONDCP will ordinarily collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. ONDCP will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under § 1401.15, or the total fee to be charged is less than $25.00. ONDCP will notify you if we estimate that charges will exceed $25.00 including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication and whether applicable entitlements to duplication and search at no charge have been provided. ONDCP will not process your request until you either commit in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designate some amount of fees you are willing to pay.
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Search for records.</I> ONDCP will charge $77.00 per hour, which is a blended hourly rate for all personnel that respond to FOIA requests plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Review of records.</I> ONDCP will charge $77.00 per hour, which is a blended hourly rate for all personnel that responded to FOIA requests plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits. Records or portions of records withheld under an exemption subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed to determine the applicability of exemptions not considered. The cost for a subsequent review is assessable.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Duplication of records.</I> We will charge duplication fees to all requesters. We will honor your preference for receiving a record in a particular format if we can readily reproduce it in the form or format requested. If we provide photocopies, we will make one copy per request at the cost of $.10 per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks or other media, we will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where we must scan paper documents in order to comply with your preference to receive the records in an electronic format, we will charge you the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, we will charge the direct costs. We will provide the first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media) without charge except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Other charges.</I> ONDCP will recover the costs of providing other services such as certifying records or sending records by special methods.

<DIV8 N="1401.12" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.12   Fees to be charged—miscellaneous provisions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Payment for FOIA services may be made by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.
</P>
<P>(b) ONDCP may require advance payment where the estimated fee exceeds $250, or a requester previously failed to pay within 30 days of the billing date.
</P>
<P>(c) ONDCP may assess interest charges beginning the 31st day of billing. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 of the United States Code and will accrue from the date of the billing.

<HEAD>§ 1401.13   Fees to be charged—categories of requesters.</HEAD>
<P>(a) There are three categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requests; educational, non-commercial scientific institutions or representatives of the news media; and all other requesters.
</P>
<P>(b) The specific levels of fees for each of these categories are:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Commercial use request.</I> ONDCP will recover the full direct cost of providing search, review and duplication services. Commercial use requests will not receive free search-time or free reproduction of documents.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Educational and non-commercial scientific institution request.</I> ONDCP will charge the cost of reproduction, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. Requesters must demonstrate the request is authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought for scholarly or scientific research not a commercial use.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Request from representative of the news media.</I> ONDCP will charge the cost of reproduction, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. Requesters must meet the criteria in § 1401.3, and the request must not be made for a commercial use. A request that supports the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered a commercial use.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>All other requesters.</I> ONDCP will recover the full direct cost of the search and the reproduction of records, excluding the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time.

<HEAD>§ 1401.14   Restrictions on charging fees.</HEAD>
<P>(a) No search fees will be charged for requests by educational institutions (unless the records are sought for a commercial use), noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.
</P>
<P>(b) If ONDCP fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in § 1401.13(b)(2), may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
</P>
<P>(c) If ONDCP determines that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and the agency provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.
</P>
<P>(d) If ONDCP determines that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply, and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the agency may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in § 1401.13(b)(2) of this section, may charge duplication fees if the following steps are taken. ONDCP must have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and the agency must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, ONDCP may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.
</P>
<P>(e) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

<P>(g) When, after first deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is $25.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="1401.15" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.15   Waiver or reduction of fees.</HEAD>
<P>Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees:
</P>
<P>(a) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
</P>
<P>(b) ONDCP must furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In deciding whether this standard is satisfied the agency must consider the factors described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section:
</P>
<P>(1) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.
</P>
<P>(2) Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:
</P>
<P>(i) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.
</P>
<P>(ii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. ONDCP will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.
</P>
<P>(3) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, ONDCP will consider the following criteria:
</P>
<P>(i) ONDCP must identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.
</P>
<P>(ii) If there is an identified commercial interest, the component must determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of § 1401.15(a) are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. ONDCP ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied the requirements of § 1401.15(a), the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.
</P>
<P>(c) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those records.
</P>
<P>(d) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to ONDCP and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester shall be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.

<HEAD>§ 1401.16   Aggregation of requests.</HEAD>
<P>When ONDCP reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the Agency may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The Agency may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, ONDCP will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.

<DIV8 N="1401.17" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.17   Markings on released documents.</HEAD>
<P>When requested records contain matters that are exempted under 5 U.S.C. 552(b), but such exempted matters can be reasonably segregated from the remainder of the records, the records shall be disclosed by ONDCP with the necessary redactions. If records are disclosed in part, ONDCP will mark them to show the amount and location of information redacted and the exemption(s) under which the redactions were made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.

<DIV8 N="1401.18" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.18   Confidential commercial information.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Definitions.</I> As used in this section:
</P>
<P><I>Confidential commercial information</I> means commercial or financial information obtained by ONDCP from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).
</P>
<P><I>Submitter</I> means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides confidential commercial information, either directly or indirectly to the Federal Government.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Designation of confidential commercial information.</I> A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, at the time of submission, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>When notice to submitters is required.</I> (1) ONDCP must promptly provide written notice to the submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if ONDCP determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:
</P>
<P>(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or
</P>
<P>(ii) ONDCP has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.
</P>
<P>(2) The notice must either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, ONDCP may post or publish a notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Exceptions to submitter notice requirements.</I> The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:
</P>
<P>(1) ONDCP determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA, and therefore will not be disclosed;
</P>
<P>(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;
</P>
<P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or
</P>
<P>(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such case, ONDCP must give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Opportunity to object to disclosure.</I> (1) ONDCP must specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced above.
</P>
<P>(2) If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide ONDCP a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as the basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is confidential.
</P>
<P>(3) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. ONDCP is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Analysis of objections.</I> ONDCP must consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Notice of intent to disclose.</I> Whenever ONDCP decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, ONDCP must provide the submitter written notice, which must include:
</P>
<P>(1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;
</P>
<P>(2) A description of the information to be disclosed or copies of the records as ONDCP intends to release them; and
</P>
<P>(3) A specified disclosure date, which must be a reasonable time after the notice.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</I> Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, ONDCP must promptly notify the submitter.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Requester notification.</I> ONDCP must notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>No right or benefit.</I> The requirements of this section such as notification do not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.

<DIV8 N="1401.20" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.20   Purpose and scope.</HEAD>
<P>This subpart implements the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, a Federal law that requires Federal agencies to protect private information about individuals that the agencies collect or maintain. It establishes ONDCP's rules for access to records in systems of records we maintain that are retrieved by an individual's name or another personal identifier. It describes the procedures by which individuals may request access to records, request amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of disclosures of those records by ONDCP. Whenever it is appropriate to do so, ONDCP automatically processes a Privacy Act request for access to records under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA, following the rules contained in this part. ONDCP processes a request under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA so you will receive the maximum amount of information available to you by law.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="1401.21" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.21   How do I make a Privacy Act request?</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>In general.</I> You can make a Privacy Act request for records about yourself. You also can make a request on behalf of another individual as the parent or legal guardian of a minor, or as the legal guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>How do I make a request?</I> (1) <I>Where do I send my written request?</I> To make a request for access to a record, you should write directly to our Office of General Counsel. Heightened security delays mail delivery. To avoid mail delivery delays, we strongly suggest that you email your request to <I>foia@ondcp.eop.gov.</I> Our mailing address is: SSDMD/RDS; ONDCP Office of General Counsel; Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling (JBAB); Bldg. 410/Door 123; 250 Murray Lane SW, Washington, DC 20509. To make sure that the Office of General Counsel receives your request without delay, you should include the notation “Privacy Act Request” in the subject line of your email or on the front of your envelope and also at the beginning of your request.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Security concerns.</I> To protect our computer systems, we reserve the right not to open attachments to emailed requests. We request that you include your request within the body of the email.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>What should my request include?</I> You must describe the record that you seek in enough detail to enable ONDCP to locate the system of records containing the record with a reasonable amount of effort. Include specific information about each record sought, such as the time period in which you believe it was compiled, the name or identifying number of each system of records in which you believe it is kept, and the date, title or name, author, recipient, or subject matter of the record. As a general rule, the more specific you are about the record that you seek, the more likely we will be able to locate it in response to your request.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>How do I request amendment of a record?</I> If you are requesting an amendment of an ONDCP record, you must identify each particular record in question and the system of records in which the record is located, describe the amendment that you seek, and state why you believe that the record is not accurate, relevant, timely or complete. You may submit any documentation that you think would be helpful, including an annotated copy of the record.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>How do I request an accounting of record disclosures?</I> If you are requesting an accounting of disclosures made by ONDCP to another person, organization or Federal agency, you must identify each system of records in question. An accounting generally includes the date, nature and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization, or Federal agency to which the disclosure was made.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Verification of identity.</I> When making a Privacy Act request, you must verify your identity in accordance with these procedures to protect your privacy or the privacy of the individual on whose behalf you are acting. If you make a Privacy Act request and you do not follow these identity verification procedures, ONDCP cannot process your request.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>How do I verify my own identity?</I> You must include in your request your full name, citizenship status, current address, and date and place of birth. We may request additional information to verify your identity. To verify your own identity, you must provide an unsworn declaration under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury. To fulfill this requirement, you must include the following statement just before the signature on your request:
</P>
<EXTRACT>
<P>I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on [date].</P></EXTRACT>
<P>(2) <I>How do I verify parentage or guardianship?</I> If you make a request as the parent or legal guardian of a minor, or as the legal guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent, for access to records or information about that individual, you must establish:
</P>
<P>(i) The identity of the individual who is the subject of the record, by stating the individual's name, citizenship status, current address, and date and place of birth;
</P>
<P>(ii) Your own identity, as required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section;
</P>
<P>(iii) That you are the parent or legal guardian of the individual, which you may prove by providing a copy of the individual's birth certificate showing your parentage or a court order establishing your guardianship; and
</P>
<P>(iv) That you are acting on behalf of the individual in making the request.

<DIV8 N="1401.22" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.22   How will ONDCP respond to my Privacy Act request?</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>When will we respond to your request?</I> We will search to determine if the requested records exist in a system of records ONDCP owns or controls. The Office of General Counsel will respond to you in writing within 20 days after we receive your request and/or within ten working days after we receive your request for an amendment, if it meets the requirements of this subpart. We may extend the response time in unusual circumstances, such as the need to consult with another agency about a record or to retrieve a record that is in storage.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>What will our response include?</I> (1) Our written response will include our determination whether to grant or deny your request in whole or in part, a brief explanation of the reasons for the determination, and the amount of the fee charged, if any, under § 1401.24. If you requested access to records, we will make the records, if any, available to you. If you requested amendment of a record, the response will describe any amendments made and advise you of your right to obtain a copy of the amended record.
</P>
<P>(2) We will also notify the individual who is subject to the record in writing, if, based on your request, any system of records contains a record pertaining to him or her.
</P>
<P>(3) If ONDCP makes an adverse determination with respect to your request, our written response will identify the name and address of the person responsible for the adverse determination, that the adverse determination is not a final agency action, and describe the procedures by which you may appeal the adverse determination under § 1401.23.
</P>
<P>(4) An adverse determination is a response to a Privacy Act request that:
</P>
<P>(i) Withholds any requested record in whole or in part;
</P>
<P>(ii) Denies a request to amend a record in whole or in part;
</P>
<P>(iii) Declines to provide an accounting of disclosures;
</P>
<P>(iv) Advises that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located;
</P>
<P>(v) Finds that what you requested is not a record subject to the Privacy Act; or
</P>
<P>(vi) Advises on any disputed fee matter.

<DIV8 N="1401.23" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="9">
<HEAD>§ 1401.23   What can I do if I am dissatisfied with ONDCP's response to my Privacy Act request?</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>What can I appeal?</I> You can appeal any adverse determination in writing to our Director or designee within 90 calendar days after the date of our response. We provide a list of adverse determinations in § 1401.22(b)(3).
</P>
<P>(b) <I>How do I make an appeal?</I> (1) <I>What should I include?</I> You may appeal by submitting a written statement giving the reasons why you believe the Director or designee should overturn the adverse determination. Your written appeal may include as much or as little related information as you wish to provide, as long as it clearly identifies the determination (including the request number, if known) that you are appealing.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Where do I send my appeal?</I> You should mark both your letter and the envelope, or the subject of your email, “Privacy Act Appeal.” To avoid mail delivery delays caused by heightened security, we strongly suggest that you email any appeal to <I>foia@ondcp.eop.gov.</I> Our mailing address is: SSDMD/RDS; ONDCP Office of General Counsel; Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling (JBAB); Bldg. 410/Door 123; 250 Murray Lane SW, Washington, DC 20509.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Who will decide your appeal?</I> (1) The Director or designee will act on all appeals under this section.

</P>
<P>(e) <I>What will our response include?</I> The written response will include the Director or designee's determination whether to grant or deny your appeal in whole or in part, a brief explanation of the reasons for the determination, and information about the Privacy Act provisions for court review of the determination.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Appeals concerning access to records.</I> If your appeal concerns a request for access to records and the appeal is granted in whole or in part, we will make the records, if any, available to you.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Appeals concerning amendments.</I> If your appeal concerns amendment of a record, the response will describe any amendment made and advise you of your right to obtain a copy of the amended record. We will notify all persons, organizations or Federal agencies to which we previously disclosed the record, if an accounting of that disclosure was made, that the record has been amended. Whenever the record is subsequently disclosed, the record will be disclosed as amended. If our response denies your request for an amendment to a record, we will advise you of your right to file a statement of disagreement under paragraph (f) of this section.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Statements of disagreement</I>—(1) <I>What is a statement of disagreement?</I> A statement of disagreement is a concise written statement in which you clearly identify each part of any record that you dispute and explain your reason(s) for disagreeing with our denial in whole or in part of your appeal requesting amendment.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>How do I file a statement of disagreement?</I> You should mark both your letter and the envelope, or the subject of your email, “Privacy Act Statement of Disagreement.” To avoid mail delivery delays caused by heightened security, we strongly suggest that you email a statement of disagreement to <I>foia@ondcp.eop.gov.</I> Our mailing address is: SSDMD/RDS; ONDCP Office of General Counsel; Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling (JBAB); Bldg. 410/Door 123; 250 Murray Lane SW, Washington, DC 20509.

<HEAD>§ 1401.24   What does it cost to get records under the Privacy Act?</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Agreement to pay fees.</I> Your request is an agreement to pay fees. We consider your Privacy Act request as your agreement to pay all applicable fees unless you specify a limit on the amount of fees you agree to pay. We will not exceed the specified limit without your written agreement.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>How do we calculate fees?</I> We will charge a fee for duplication of a record under the Privacy Act in the same way we charge for duplication of records under the FOIA in § 1401.11(c). There are no fees to search for or review records requested under the Privacy Act.
