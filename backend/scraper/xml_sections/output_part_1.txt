<P>Section 403(e) of the act (in this part 1, the term <I>act</I> means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) provides for the establishment by regulation of reasonable variations and exemptions for small packages from the required declaration of net quantity of contents.

Section 602(b) of the act provides for the establishment by regulation of reasonable variations and exemptions for small packages from the required declaration of net quantity of contents. Section 5(b) of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act provides for the establishment by regulation of exemptions from certain required declarations of net quantity of contents, identity of commodity, identity and location of manufacturer, packer, or distributor, and from declaration of net quantity of servings represented, based on a finding that full compliance with such required declarations is impracticable or not necessary for the adequate protection of consumers, and a further finding that the nature, form, or quantity of the packaged consumer commodity or other good and sufficient reasons justify such exemptions. The Commissioner, on his own initiative or on petition of an interested person, may propose a variation or exemption based upon any of the foregoing statutory provisions, including proposed findings if section 5(b) of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act applies, pursuant to parts 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 19 of this chapter.

<HEAD>§ 1.226   Who does not have to register under this subpart?</HEAD>
<P>This subpart does not apply to the following facilities:
</P>
<P>(a) A foreign facility, if food from such facility undergoes further manufacturing/processing (including packaging) by another facility outside the United States. A facility is not exempt under this provision if the further manufacturing/processing (including packaging) conducted by the subsequent facility consists of adding labeling or any similar activity of a <I>de minimis</I> nature;

However, those fishing vessels otherwise engaged in processing fish are subject to this subpart. For the purposes of this section, “processing” means handling, storing, preparing, shucking, changing into different market forms, manufacturing, preserving, packing, labeling, dockside unloading, holding, or heading, eviscerating, or freezing other than solely to prepare fish for holding on board a harvest vessel;
</P>
<P>(g) Facilities that are regulated exclusively, throughout the entire facility, by the U.S. Department of Agriculture under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 <I>et seq.</I>), the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 <I>et seq.</I>), or the Egg Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 1031 <I>et seq.</I>);

<HEAD>§ 1.227   What definitions apply to this subpart?</HEAD>
<P>The definitions of terms in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act apply to such terms when used in this subpart. In addition, for the purposes of this subpart:
</P>
<P><I>Calendar day</I> means every day shown on the calendar.
</P>
<P><I>Facility</I> means any establishment, structure, or structures under one ownership at one general physical location, or, in the case of a mobile facility, traveling to multiple locations, that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for consumption in the United States. Transport vehicles are not facilities if they hold food only in the usual course of business as carriers. A facility may consist of one or more contiguous structures, and a single building may house more than one distinct facility if the facilities are under separate ownership. The private residence of an individual is not a facility. Nonbottled water drinking water collection and distribution establishments and their structures are not facilities.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Domestic facility</I> means any facility located in any State or Territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for consumption in the United States.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Foreign facility</I> means a facility other than a domestic facility that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for consumption in the United States.
</P>
<P><I>Farm</I> means:
</P>
<P>(1) Primary production farm. A primary production farm is an operation under one management in one general (but not necessarily contiguous) physical location devoted to the growing of crops, the harvesting of crops, the raising of animals (including seafood), or any combination of these activities. The term “farm” includes operations that, in addition to these activities:
</P>
<P>(i) Pack or hold raw agricultural commodities;
</P>
<P>(ii) Pack or hold processed food, provided that all processed food used in such activities is either consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management, or is processed food identified in paragraph (1)(iii)(B)(<I>1</I>) of this definition; and
</P>
<P>(iii) Manufacture/process food, provided that:
</P>
<P>(A) All food used in such activities is consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management; or
</P>
<P>(B) Any manufacturing/processing of food that is not consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management consists only of:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) Drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), and packaging and labeling such commodities, without additional manufacturing/processing (an example of additional manufacturing/processing is slicing);
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) Treatment to manipulate the ripening of raw agricultural commodities (such as by treating produce with ethylene gas), and packaging and labeling treated raw agricultural commodities, without additional manufacturing/processing; and
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) Packaging and labeling raw agricultural commodities, when these activities do not involve additional manufacturing/processing (an example of additional manufacturing/processing is irradiation); or
</P>
<P>(2) Secondary activities farm. A secondary activities farm is an operation, not located on a primary production farm, devoted to harvesting (such as hulling or shelling), packing, and/or holding of raw agricultural commodities, provided that the primary production farm(s) that grows, harvests, and/or raises the majority of the raw agricultural commodities harvested, packed, and/or held by the secondary activities farm owns, or jointly owns, a majority interest in the secondary activities farm. A secondary activities farm may also conduct those additional activities allowed on a primary production farm as described in paragraphs (1)(ii) and (iii) of this definition.
</P>
<P><I>Food</I> has the meaning given in section 201(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act:
</P>
<P>(1) Except for purposes of this subpart, it does not include:
</P>
<P>(i) Food contact substances as defined in section 409(h)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Pesticides as defined in 7 U.S.C. 136(u).
</P>
<P>(2) Examples of food include: Fruits, vegetables, fish, dairy products, eggs, raw agricultural commodities for use as food or as components of food, animal feed (including pet food), food and feed ingredients, food and feed additives, dietary supplements and dietary ingredients, infant formula, beverages (including alcoholic beverages and bottled water), live food animals, bakery goods, snack foods, candy, and canned foods.
</P>
<P><I>Harvesting</I> applies to farms and farm mixed-type facilities and means activities that are traditionally performed on farms for the purpose of removing raw agricultural commodities from the place they were grown or raised and preparing them for use as food. Harvesting is limited to activities performed on raw agricultural commodities, or on processed foods created by drying/dehydrating a raw agricultural commodity without additional manufacturing/processing, on a farm. Harvesting does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of harvesting include cutting (or otherwise separating) the edible portion of the raw agricultural commodity from the crop plant and removing or trimming part of the raw agricultural commodity (<I>e.g.,</I> foliage, husks, roots or stems). Examples of harvesting also include cooling, field coring, filtering, gathering, hulling, shelling, sifting, threshing, trimming of outer leaves of, and washing raw agricultural commodities grown on a farm.
</P>
<P><I>Holding</I> means storage of food and also includes activities performed incidental to storage of a food (<I>e.g.,</I> activities performed for the safe or effective storage of that food, such as fumigating food during storage, and drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities when the drying/dehydrating does not create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating hay or alfalfa)). Holding also includes activities performed as a practical necessity for the distribution of that food (such as blending of the same raw agricultural commodity and breaking down pallets), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Holding facilities could include warehouses, cold storage facilities, storage silos, grain elevators, and liquid storage tanks.
</P>
<P><I>Manufacturing/processing</I> means making food from one or more ingredients, or synthesizing, preparing, treating, modifying or manipulating food, including food crops or ingredients. Examples of manufacturing/processing activities include: Baking, boiling, bottling, canning, cooking, cooling, cutting, distilling, drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), evaporating, eviscerating, extracting juice, formulating, freezing, grinding, homogenizing, irradiating, labeling, milling, mixing, packaging (including modified atmosphere packaging), pasteurizing, peeling, rendering, treating to manipulate ripening, trimming, washing, or waxing. For farms and farm mixed-type facilities, manufacturing/processing does not include activities that are part of harvesting, packing, or holding.
</P>
<P><I>Mixed-type facility</I> means an establishment that engages in both activities that are exempt from registration under section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and activities that require the establishment to be registered. An example of such a facility is a “farm mixed-type facility,” which is an establishment that is a farm, but also conducts activities outside the farm definition that require the establishment to be registered.
</P>
<P><I>Nonprofit food establishment</I> means a charitable entity that prepares or serves food directly to the consumer or otherwise provides food or meals for consumption by humans or animals in the United States. The term includes central food banks, soup kitchens, and nonprofit food delivery services. To be considered a nonprofit food establishment, the establishment must meet the terms of section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)).
</P>
<P><I>Packaging</I> (when used as a verb) means placing food into a container that directly contacts the food and that the consumer receives.
</P>
<P><I>Packing</I> means placing food into a container other than packaging the food and also includes re-packing and activities performed incidental to packing or re-packing a food (<I>e.g.,</I> activities performed for the safe or effective packing or re-packing of that food (such as sorting, culling, grading, and weighing or conveying incidental to packing or re-packing)), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity, as defined in section 201(r) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P><I>Restaurant</I> means a facility that prepares and sells food directly to consumers for immediate consumption. “Restaurant” does not include facilities that provide food to interstate conveyances, central kitchens, and other similar facilities that do not prepare and serve food directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>(1) Entities in which food is provided to humans, such as cafeterias, lunchrooms, cafes, bistros, fast food establishments, food stands, saloons, taverns, bars, lounges, catering facilities, hospital kitchens, day care kitchens, and nursing home kitchens are restaurants; and

<P><I>Retail food establishment</I> means an establishment that sells food products directly to consumers as its primary function. The term “retail food establishment” includes facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold food if the establishment's primary function is to sell from that establishment food, including food that it manufactures, processes, packs, or holds, directly to consumers. A retail food establishment's primary function is to sell food directly to consumers if the annual monetary value of sales of food products directly to consumers exceeds the annual monetary value of sales of food products to all other buyers. The term “consumers” does not include businesses. A “retail food establishment” includes grocery stores, convenience stores, and vending machine locations. A “retail food establishment” also includes certain farm-operated businesses selling food directly to consumers as their primary function.
</P>
<P>(1) Sale of food directly to consumers from an establishment located on a farm includes sales by that establishment directly to consumers:
</P>
<P>(i) At a roadside stand (a stand situated on the side of or near a road or thoroughfare at which a farmer sells food from his or her farm directly to consumers) or farmers' market (a location where one or more local farmers assemble to sell food from their farms directly to consumers);
</P>
<P>(ii) Through a community supported agriculture program. Community supported agriculture (CSA) program means a program under which a farmer or group of farmers grows food for a group of shareholders (or subscribers) who pledge to buy a portion of the farmer's crop(s) for that season. This includes CSA programs in which a group of farmers consolidate their crops at a central location for distribution to shareholders or subscribers; and
</P>
<P>(iii) At other such direct-to-consumer sales platforms, including door-to-door sales; mail, catalog and Internet order, including online farmers markets and online grocery delivery; religious or other organization bazaars; and State and local fairs.
</P>
<P>(2) Sale of food directly to consumers by a farm-operated business includes the sale of food by that farm-operated business directly to consumers:
</P>
<P>(i) At a roadside stand (a stand situated on the side of or near a road or thoroughfare at which a farmer sells food from his or her farm directly to consumers) or farmers' market (a location where one or more local farmers assemble to sell food from their farms directly to consumers);
</P>
<P>(ii) Through a community supported agriculture program. Community supported agriculture (CSA) program means a program under which a farmer or group of farmers grows food for a group of shareholders (or subscribers) who pledge to buy a portion of the farmer's crop(s) for that season. This includes CSA programs in which a group of farmers consolidate their crops at a central location for distribution to shareholders or subscribers; and
</P>
<P>(iii) At other such direct-to-consumer sales platforms, including door-to-door sales; mail, catalog and Internet order, including online farmers markets and online grocery delivery; religious or other organization bazaars; and State and local fairs.
</P>
<P>(3) For the purposes of this definition, “farm-operated business” means a business that is managed by one or more farms and conducts manufacturing/processing not on the farm(s).
</P>
<P><I>Trade name</I> means the name or names under which the facility conducts business, or additional names by which the facility is known. A trade name is associated with a facility, and a brand name is associated with a product.
</P>
<P><I>U.S. agent</I> means a person (as defined in section 201(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(e))) residing or maintaining a place of business in the United States whom a foreign facility designates as its agent for purposes of this subpart. A U.S. agent may not be in the form of a mailbox, answering machine or service, or other place where an individual acting as the foreign facility's agent is not physically present.
</P>
<P>(1) The U.S. agent acts as a communications link between FDA and the foreign facility for both emergency and routine communications. The U.S. agent will be the person FDA contacts when an emergency occurs, unless the registration specifies another emergency contact.
</P>
<P>(2) FDA will treat representations by the U.S. agent as those of the foreign facility, and will consider information or documents provided to the U.S. agent the equivalent of providing the information or documents to the foreign facility. FDA will consider the U.S. agent the equivalent of the registrant for purposes of sharing information and communications. The U.S. agent of a foreign facility may view the information submitted in the foreign facility's registration.
</P>
<P>(3) Having a single U.S. agent for the purposes of this subpart does not preclude facilities from having multiple agents (such as foreign suppliers) for other business purposes. A firm's commercial business in the United States need not be conducted through the U.S. agent designated for purposes of this subpart.
</P>
<P><I>You or registrant</I> means the owner, operator, or agent in charge of a facility that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for consumption in the United States.

<HEAD>Additional Provisions</HEAD>


<DIV8 N="1.240" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="1">
<HEAD>§ 1.240   What other registration requirements apply?</HEAD>
<P>In addition to the requirements of this subpart, you must comply with the registration regulations found in part 108 of this chapter, related to emergency permit control, and any other Federal, State, or local registration requirements that apply to your facility.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="1.241" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="1">
<HEAD>§ 1.241   What are the consequences of failing to register, update, renew, or cancel your registration?</HEAD>
<P>(a) Section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 331) prohibits the doing of certain acts or causing such acts to be done. Under section 302 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 332), the United States can bring a civil action in Federal court to enjoin a person who commits a prohibited act. Under section 303 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 333), the United States can bring a criminal action in Federal court to prosecute a person who is responsible for the commission of a prohibited act. Under section 306 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 335a), FDA can seek debarment of any person who has been convicted of a felony relating to importation of food into the United States. Failure of an owner, operator, or agent in charge of a domestic or foreign facility to register its facility, renew the registration of its facility, update required elements of its facility's registration, or cancel its registration in accordance with the requirements of this subpart is a prohibited act under section 301(dd) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P>(b) FDA will consider a registration for a food facility to be expired if the registration is not renewed, as required by § 1.230(b). Thus, if you previously submitted a registration to FDA, but do not submit a registration renewal to FDA during the period beginning on October 1 and ending on December 31 of each even-numbered year, FDA will consider the registration for the facility to be expired. FDA will consider a food facility with an expired registration to have failed to register in accordance with section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P>(c) FDA will cancel a registration if FDA independently verifies that the facility is no longer in business or has changed owners, and the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the facility fails to cancel the registration, or if FDA determines that the registration is for a facility that does not exist, is not required to register, or where the information about the facility's address was not updated in a timely manner in accordance with § 1.234(a) or the registration was submitted by a person not authorized to submit the registration under § 1.225. Also, FDA will cancel a registration if the facility's registration has expired because the facility has failed to renew its registration in accordance with § 1.230(b). If FDA cancels a facility's registration, FDA will send a confirmation of the cancellation using contact information submitted by the facility in the registration database.
</P>
<P>(d) If an article of food is imported or offered for import into the United States and a foreign facility that manufactured/processed, packed, or held that article of food has not registered in accordance with this subpart, the disposition of the article of food shall be governed by the procedures set out in subpart I of this part.

<HEAD>§ 1.242   What does assignment of a registration number mean?</HEAD>
<P>Assignment of a registration number to a facility means that the facility is registered with FDA. Assignment of a registration number does not in any way convey FDA's approval or endorsement of a facility or its products.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="1.243" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="1">
<HEAD>§ 1.243   Is food registration information available to the public?</HEAD>
<P>(a) The list of registered facilities and registration documents submitted under this subpart are not subject to disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 (the Freedom of Information Act). In addition, any information derived from such list or registration documents that would disclose the identity or location of a specific registered person, is not subject to disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 (the Freedom of Information Act).

Under § 1.232(a)(6), you must provide the email address of the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the facility unless FDA has granted a waiver from such requirement.

To request a waiver from these requirements, you must submit a written request to FDA that explains why it is not reasonable for you to submit your registration, registration renewal, update, or cancellation to FDA electronically or to provide the email address of the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the facility.

<HEAD>Consequences</HEAD>


<DIV8 N="1.283" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="1">
<HEAD>§ 1.283   What happens to food that is imported or offered for import without adequate prior notice?</HEAD>
<P>(a) For each article of food that is imported or offered for import into the United States, except for food arriving by international mail or food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual, the consequences are:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Inadequate prior notice</I>—(i) <I>No prior notice.</I> If an article of food arrives at the port of arrival and no prior notice has been submitted and confirmed by FDA for review, the food is subject to refusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 381(m)(1)). If an article of food is refused for lack of prior notice, unless U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) concurrence is obtained for export and the article is immediately exported from the port of arrival under CBP supervision, it must be held within the port of entry for the article unless directed by CBP or FDA.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Inaccurate prior notice.</I> If prior notice has been submitted and confirmed by FDA for review, but upon review of the notice or examination of the article of food, the notice is determined to be inaccurate, the food is subject to refusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act. If the article of food is refused due to inaccurate prior notice, unless CBP concurrence is obtained for export and the article is immediately exported from the port of arrival under CBP supervision, it must be held within the port of entry for the article unless directed by CBP or FDA.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Untimely prior notice.</I> If prior notice has been submitted and confirmed by FDA for review, but the full time that applies under § 1.279 for prior notice has not elapsed when the article of food arrives, the food is subject to refusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act, unless FDA has already reviewed the prior notice, determined its response to the prior notice, and advised CBP of that response. If the article of food is refused due to untimely prior notice, unless CBP concurrence is obtained for export and the article is immediately exported from the port of arrival under CBP supervision, it must be held within the port of entry for the article unless directed by CBP or FDA.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Status and movement of refused food.</I> (i) An article of food that has been refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act and paragraph (a) of this section shall be considered general order merchandise as described in section 490 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1490).
</P>
<P>(ii) Refused food must be moved under appropriate custodial bond unless immediately exported under CBP supervision. If the food is to be held at the port, FDA must be notified of the location where the food is held at that port before the food is moved there. If the food is to be held at a secure facility outside the port, FDA must be notified of the location of the secure facility before the food is moved there. The refused food shall not be entered and shall not be delivered to any importer, owner, or ultimate consignee. If the food is to be held at a secure facility outside a port, the food must be taken directly to that secure facility.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Segregation of refused foods.</I> If an article of food that is refused is part of a shipment that contains articles of food that have not been placed under hold or other merchandise not subject to this subpart, the refused article of food may be segregated from the rest of the shipment. This segregation must take place where the article is held. FDA or CBP may supervise segregation. If FDA or CBP determines that supervision is necessary, segregation must not take place without supervision.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Costs.</I> Neither FDA nor CBP are liable for transportation, storage, or other expenses resulting from refusal.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Export after refusal.</I> An article of food that has been refused under paragraph (a) of this section may be exported with CBP concurrence and under CBP supervision unless it is seized or administratively detained by FDA or CBP under other authority. If an article of food that has been refused admission under paragraph (a) of this section is exported, the prior notice should be cancelled within 5-business days of exportation.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>No post-refusal submission or request for review.</I> If an article of food is refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act and no prior notice is submitted or resubmitted, no request for FDA review is submitted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, or export has not occurred in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the article of food shall be dealt with as set forth in CBP regulations relating to general order merchandise (19 CFR part 127), except that, unless otherwise agreed to by CBP and FDA, the article may only be sold for export or destroyed.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual.</I> If food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual arriving in the United States is not for personal use and does not have adequate prior notice or the individual cannot provide FDA or CBP with a copy of the prior notice (PN) confirmation, the food is subject to refusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act. If before leaving the port, the individual does not arrange to have the food held at the port or exported, FDA or CBP may destroy the article of food.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Post-Refusal prior notice submissions.</I> (1) If an article of food is refused under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section (no prior notice) and the food is not exported, prior notice must be submitted in accordance with §§ 1.280 and 1.281(c).
</P>
<P>(2) If an article of food is refused under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section (inaccurate prior notice) and the food is not exported, the prior notice should be canceled in accordance with § 1.282 and you must resubmit prior notice in accordance with §§ 1.280 and 1.281(c).
</P>
<P>(3) Once the prior notice has been submitted or resubmitted and confirmed by FDA for review, FDA will endeavor to review and respond to the prior notice submission within the timeframes set out in § 1.279.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>FDA review after refusal.</I> (1) If an article of food has been refused admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act, a request may be submitted asking FDA to review whether the article is subject to the requirements of this subpart under § 1.277, or whether the information submitted in a prior notice is complete and accurate. A request for review may not be used to submit prior notice or to resubmit an inaccurate prior notice.
</P>
<P>(2) A request may be submitted only by the carrier, submitter, importer, owner, or ultimate consignee. A request must identify which one the requester is.
</P>
<P>(3) A request must be submitted in writing to FDA and delivered by fax or e-mail. The location for receipt of a request is listed at <I>http://www.fda.gov</I>—see Prior Notice. A request must include all factual and legal information necessary for FDA to conduct its review. Only one request for review may be submitted for each refused article.
</P>
<P>(4) The request must be submitted within 5-calendar days of the refusal. FDA will review and respond within 5-calendar days of receiving the request.
</P>
<P>(5) If FDA determines that the article is not subject to the requirements of this subpart under § 1.277 or that the prior notice submission is complete and accurate, it will notify the requester, the transmitter, and CBP that the food is no longer subject to refusal under section 801(m)(1) of the act.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>International mail.</I> If an article of food arrives by international mail with inadequate prior notice or the PN confirmation number is not affixed as required, the parcel will be held by CBP for 72 hours for FDA inspection and disposition. If FDA refuses the article under section 801(m)(1) of the act and there is a return address, the parcel may be returned to sender marked “No Prior Notice—FDA Refused.” If the article is refused and there is no return address or FDA determines that the article of food in the parcel appears to present a hazard, FDA may dispose of or destroy the parcel at its expense. If FDA does not respond within 72 hours of the CBP hold, CBP may return the parcel to the sender or, if there is no return address, destroy the parcel, at FDA expense.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Prohibitions on delivery and transfer.</I> (1) Notwithstanding section 801(b) of the act, an article of food refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act may not be delivered to the importer, owner, or ultimate consignee until prior notice is submitted to FDA in accordance with this subpart, FDA has examined the prior notice, FDA has determined that the prior notice is adequate, and FDA has notified CBP and the transmitter that the article of food is no longer refused admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act.
</P>
<P>(2) During the time an article of food that has been refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act is held, the article may not be transferred by any person from the port or other designated secure facility until prior notice is submitted to FDA in accordance with this subpart, FDA has examined the prior notice, FDA has determined that the prior notice is adequate, and FDA has notified CBP and the transmitter that the article of food no longer is refused admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act. After this notification by FDA to CBP and transmitter, entry may be made in accordance with law and regulation.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Relationship to other admissibility decisions.</I> A determination that an article of food is no longer refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act is different than, and may come before, determinations of admissibility under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws. A determination that an article of food is no longer refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act does not mean that it will be granted admission under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws.

<P>(h) <I>Food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual.</I> If an article of food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual arriving in the United States is not for personal use and is placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act because it is from a foreign facility that is not registered as required under section 415 of the act and subpart H of this part, the individual may arrange to have the food held at the port or exported. If such arrangements cannot be made, the article of food may be destroyed.
</P>

<DIV8 N="1.328" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="1">
<HEAD>§ 1.328   What definitions apply to this subpart?</HEAD>
<P>The definitions of terms in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321) apply to such terms when used in this subpart. In addition, for the purposes of this subpart:
</P>
<P><I>Farm</I> means:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Primary production farm.</I> A primary production farm is an operation under one management in one general (but not necessarily contiguous) physical location devoted to the growing of crops, the harvesting of crops, the raising of animals (including seafood), or any combination of these activities. The term “farm” includes operations that, in addition to these activities:
</P>
<P>(i) Pack or hold raw agricultural commodities;
</P>
<P>(ii) Pack or hold processed food, provided that all processed food used in such activities is either consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management, or is processed food identified in paragraph (1)(iii)(B)(<I>1</I>) of this definition; and
</P>
<P>(iii) Manufacture/process food, provided that:
</P>
<P>(A) All food used in such activities is consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management; or
</P>
<P>(B) Any manufacturing/processing of food that is not consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management consists only of:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) Drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), and packaging and labeling such commodities, without additional manufacturing/processing (an example of additional manufacturing/processing is slicing);
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) Treatment to manipulate the ripening of raw agricultural commodities (such as by treating produce with ethylene gas), and packaging and labeling treated raw agricultural commodities, without additional manufacturing/processing; and
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) Packaging and labeling raw agricultural commodities, when these activities do not involve additional manufacturing/processing (an example of additional manufacturing/processing is irradiation); or
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Secondary activities farm.</I> A secondary activities farm is an operation, not located on a primary production farm, devoted to harvesting (such as hulling or shelling), packing, and/or holding of raw agricultural commodities, provided that the primary production farm(s) that grows, harvests, and/or raises the majority of the raw agricultural commodities harvested, packed, and/or held by the secondary activities farm owns, or jointly owns, a majority interest in the secondary activities farm. A secondary activities farm may also conduct those additional activities allowed on a primary production farm as described in paragraphs (1)(ii) and (iii) of this definition.
</P>
<P><I>Food</I> has the meaning given in section 201(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of food include, but are not limited to fruits; vegetables; fish; dairy products; eggs; raw agricultural commodities for use as food or as components of food; animal feed, including pet food; food and feed ingredients and additives, including substances that migrate into food from the finished container and other articles that contact food; dietary supplements and dietary ingredients; infant formula; beverages, including alcoholic beverages and bottled water; live food animals; bakery goods; snack foods; candy; and canned foods.
</P>
<P><I>Full-time equivalent employee</I> means all individuals employed by the person claiming the exemption. The number of full-time equivalent employees is determined by dividing the total number of hours of salary or wages paid directly to employees of the person and of all of its affiliates by the number of hours of work in 1 year, 2,080 hours (i.e., 40 hours × 52 weeks).
</P>
<P><I>Harvesting</I> applies to farms and farm mixed-type facilities and means activities that are traditionally performed on farms for the purpose of removing raw agricultural commodities from the place they were grown or raised and preparing them for use as food. Harvesting is limited to activities performed on raw agricultural commodities, or on processed foods created by drying/dehydrating a raw agricultural commodity without additional manufacturing/processing, on a farm. Harvesting does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of harvesting include cutting (or otherwise separating) the edible portion of the raw agricultural commodity from the crop plant and removing or trimming part of the raw agricultural commodity (<I>e.g.,</I> foliage, husks, roots, or stems). Examples of harvesting also include cooling, field coring, filtering, gathering, hulling, shelling, sifting, threshing, trimming of outer leaves of, and washing raw agricultural commodities grown on a farm.
</P>
<P><I>Holding</I> means storage of food and also includes activities performed incidental to storage of a food (<I>e.g.,</I> activities performed for the safe or effective storage of that food, such as fumigating food during storage, and drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities when the drying/dehydrating does not create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating hay or alfalfa)). Holding also includes activities performed as a practical necessity for the distribution of that food (such as blending of the same raw agricultural commodity and breaking down pallets), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Holding facilities could include warehouses, cold storage facilities, storage silos, grain elevators, and liquid storage tanks.
</P>
<P><I>Manufacturing/processing</I> means making food from one or more ingredients, or synthesizing, preparing, treating, modifying or manipulating food, including food crops or ingredients. Examples of manufacturing/processing activities include: Baking, boiling, bottling, canning, cooking, cooling, cutting, distilling, drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), evaporating, eviscerating, extracting juice, formulating, freezing, grinding, homogenizing, irradiating, labeling, milling, mixing, packaging (including modified atmosphere packaging), pasteurizing, peeling, rendering, treating to manipulate ripening, trimming, washing, or waxing. For farms and farm mixed-type facilities, manufacturing/processing does not include activities that are part of harvesting, packing, or holding.
</P>
<P><I>Mixed-type facility</I> means an establishment that engages in both activities that are exempt from registration under section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and activities that require the establishment to be registered. An example of such a facility is a “farm mixed-type facility,” which is an establishment that is a farm, but also conducts activities outside the farm definition that require the establishment to be registered.
</P>
<P><I>Nonprofit food establishment</I> means a charitable entity that prepares or serves food directly to the consumer or otherwise provides food or meals for consumption by humans or animals in the United States. The term includes central food banks, soup kitchens, and nonprofit food delivery services. To be considered a nonprofit food establishment, the establishment must meet the terms of section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)).
</P>
<P><I>Nontransporter</I> means a person who owns food or who holds, manufactures, processes, packs, imports, receives, or distributes food for purposes other than transportation.
</P>
<P><I>Nontransporter immediate previous source</I> means a person that last had food before transferring it to another nontransporter.
</P>
<P><I>Nontransporter immediate subsequent recipient</I> means a nontransporter that acquires food from another nontransporter.
</P>
<P><I>Packaging</I> (when used as a noun) means the outer packaging of food that bears the label and does not contact the food. Packaging does not include food contact substances as they are defined in section 409(h)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P><I>Packaging</I> (when used as a verb) means placing food into a container that directly contacts the food and that the consumer receives.
</P>
<P><I>Packing</I> means placing food into a container other than packaging the food and also includes re-packing and activities performed incidental to packing or re-packing a food (<I>e.g.,</I> activities performed for the safe or effective packing or re-packing of that food (such as sorting, culling, grading, and weighing or conveying incidental to packing or re-packing)), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity, as defined in section 201(r) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P><I>Person</I> includes individual, partnership, corporation, and association.
</P>
<P><I>Recipe</I> means the formula, including ingredients, quantities, and instructions, necessary to manufacture a food product. Because a recipe must have all three elements, a list of the ingredients used to manufacture a product without quantity information and manufacturing instructions is not a recipe.
</P>
<P><I>Restaurant</I> means a facility that prepares and sells food directly to consumers for immediate consumption. “Restaurant” does not include facilities that provide food to interstate conveyances, central kitchens, and other similar facilities that do not prepare and serve food directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>(1) Facilities in which food is directly provided to humans, such as cafeterias, lunchrooms, cafes, bistros, fast food establishments, food stands, saloons, taverns, bars, lounges, catering facilities, hospital kitchens, day care kitchens, and nursing home kitchens, are restaurants.
</P>
<P>(2) Pet shelters, kennels, and veterinary facilities in which food is directly provided to animals are restaurants.
</P>
<P><I>Transporter</I> means a person who has possession, custody, or control of an article of food in the United States for the sole purpose of transporting the food, whether by road, rail, water, or air. Transporter also includes a foreign person that transports food in the United States, regardless of whether that foreign person has possession, custody, or control of that food for the sole purpose of transporting that food.
</P>
<P><I>Transporter's immediate previous source</I> means a person from whom a transporter received food. This source can be either another transporter or a nontransporter.
</P>
<P><I>Transporter's immediate subsequent recipient</I> means a person to whom a transporter delivered food. This recipient can be either another transporter or a nontransporter.
</P>
<P><I>You</I> means a person subject to this subpart under § 1.326.

<DIV8 N="1.330" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="1">
<HEAD>§ 1.330   Can existing records satisfy the requirements of this subpart?</HEAD>
<P>The regulations in this subpart do not require duplication of existing records if those records contain all of the information required by this subpart. If a covered person keeps records of all of the information as required by this subpart to comply with other Federal, State, or local regulations, or for any other reason, then those records may be used to meet these requirements. Moreover, persons do not have to keep all of the information required by this rule in one set of records. If they have records containing some of the required information, they may keep those existing records and keep, either separately or in a combined form, any new information required by this rule. There is no obligation to create an entirely new record or compilation of records containing both existing and new information, even if the records containing some of the required information were not created at the time the food was received or released.

<HEAD>§ 1.653   What must an accredited third-party certification body do when issuing food or facility certifications?</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Basis for issuance of a food or facility certification.</I> (1) Prior to issuing a food or facility certification to an eligible entity, an accredited third-party certification body (or, where applicable, an audit agent on its behalf) must complete a regulatory audit that meets the requirements of § 1.651 and any other activities that may be necessary to determine compliance with the applicable food safety requirements of the FD&amp;C Act and FDA regulations.
</P>
<P>(2) If, as a result of an observation during a regulatory audit, an eligible entity must implement a corrective action plan to address a deficiency, an accredited third-party certification body may not issue a food or facility certification to such entity until after the accredited third-party certification body verifies that eligible entity has implemented the corrective action plan through methods that reliably verify the corrective action was taken and as a result the identified deficiency is unlikely to recur, except onsite verification is required for corrective actions required to address deficiencies that are the subject of a notification under § 1.656(c).
</P>
<P>(3) An accredited third-party certification body must consider each observation and the data and other information from a regulatory audit and other activities conducted under § 1.651 to determine whether the entity was in compliance with the applicable food safety requirements of the FD&amp;C Act and FDA regulations at the time of the audit and whether the eligible entity, given its food safety system and practices, would be likely to remain in compliance for the duration of any certification issued under this subpart.
</P>
<P>(4) A single regulatory audit may result in issuance of one or more food or facility certifications under this subpart, provided that the requirements of issuance are met as to each such certification.
</P>
<P>(5) Where an accredited third-party certification body uses an audit agent to conduct a regulatory audit of an eligible entity under this subpart, the accredited third-party certification body (and not the audit agent) must make the determination whether to issue a food or facility certification based on the results of such regulatory audit.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Issuance of a food or facility certification and submission to FDA.</I> (1) Any food or facility certification issued under this subpart must be submitted to FDA electronically and in English. The accredited third-party certification body may issue a food or facility certification under this subpart for a term of up to 12 months.
</P>
<P>(2) A food or facility certification must contain, at a minimum, the following elements:
</P>
<P>(i) The name and address of the accredited third-party certification body and the scope and date of its accreditation under this subpart;
</P>
<P>(ii) The name, address, FDA Establishment Identifier, and unique facility identifier, if designated by FDA, of the eligible entity to which the food or facility certification was issued;
</P>
<P>(iii) The name, address, FDA Establishment Identifier, and unique facility identifier, if designated by FDA, of the facility where the regulatory audit was conducted, if different than the eligible entity;
</P>
<P>(iv) The scope and date(s) of the regulatory audit and the certification number;
</P>
<P>(v) The name of the audit agent(s) (where applicable) conducting the regulatory audit; and

</P>
<P>(3) FDA may refuse to accept any certification for purposes of section 801(q) or 806 of the FD&amp;C Act, if FDA determines, that such food or facility certification is not valid or reliable because, for example:
</P>
<P>(i) The certification is offered in support of the admissibility of a food that was not within the scope of the certification;
</P>
<P>(ii) The certification was issued by an accredited third-party certification body acting outside the scope of its accreditation under this subpart; or

</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="1.662" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="1">
<HEAD>§ 1.662   How will FDA monitor accredited third-party certification bodies?</HEAD>
<P>(a) FDA will periodically evaluate the performance of each accredited third-party certification body to determine whether the accredited third-party certification body continues to comply with the applicable requirements of this subpart and whether there are deficiencies in the performance of the accredited third-party certification body that, if not corrected, would warrant withdrawal of its accreditation under § 1.664. FDA will evaluate each directly accredited third-party certification body annually. For a third-party certification body accredited by a recognized accreditation body, FDA will evaluate an accredited third-party certification body not later than 3 years after the date of accreditation for a 4-year term of accreditation, or by no later than the mid-term point for accreditation granted for less than 4 years. FDA may conduct additional performance assessments of an accredited third-party certification body at any time.
</P>
<P>(b) In evaluating the performance of an accredited third-party certification body under paragraph (a) of this section, FDA may review any one or more of the following:
</P>
<P>(1) Regulatory audit reports and food and facility certifications;
</P>
<P>(2) The accredited third-party certification body's self-assessments under § 1.655;

<DIV8 N="1.663" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="1">
<HEAD>§ 1.663   How do I request an FDA waiver or waiver extension for the 13-month limit for audit agents conducting regulatory audits?</HEAD>
<P>(a) An accredited third-party certification body may submit a request to FDA to waive the requirements of § 1.650(c) preventing an audit agent from conducting a regulatory audit of an eligible entity if the audit agent (or, in the case that the third-party certification body is an individual, the third-party certification body) has conducted a food safety audit of such entity during the previous 13 months. The accredited third-party certification body seeking a waiver or waiver extension must demonstrate there is insufficient access to audit agents and any third-party certification bodies that are comprised of an individual in the country or region where the eligible entity is located.
</P>
<P>(b) Requests for a waiver or waiver extension and all documents provided in support of the request must be submitted to FDA electronically, in English. The requestor must provide such translation and interpretation services as are needed by FDA to process the request.

FDA will evaluate any completed waiver request to determine whether the criteria for waiver have been met.
</P>
<P>(e) FDA will notify the requestor whether the request for a waiver or waiver extension is approved or denied.
</P>
<P>(f) If FDA approves the request, issuance of the waiver will state the duration of the waiver and list any limitations associated with it. If FDA denies the request, the issuance of a denial of a waiver request will state the basis for denial and will provide the address and procedures for requesting reconsideration of the request under § 1.691.
</P>
<P>(g) Unless FDA notifies a requestor that its waiver request has been approved, an accredited third-party certification body must not use the audit agent to conduct a regulatory audit of such eligible entity until the 13-month limit in § 1.650(c) has elapsed.

</P>
<P>(g) <I>Effect of withdrawal of accreditation on recognized accreditation bodies.</I> (1) FDA will notify a recognized accreditation body if the accreditation of a third-party certification body it accredited is withdrawn by FDA. Such accreditation body's recognition will remain in effect if, no later than 60 days after withdrawal, the accreditation body conducts a self-assessment under § 1.622 and reports the results of the self-assessment to FDA as required by § 1.623(b).

<HEAD>Subpart Q—Administrative Detention of Drugs Intended for Human or Animal Use</HEAD>


<DIV8 N="1.980" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="1">
<HEAD>§ 1.980   Administrative detention of drugs.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> This section sets forth the procedures for detention of drugs believed to be adulterated or misbranded. Administrative detention is intended to protect the public by preventing distribution or use of drugs encountered during inspections that may be adulterated or misbranded, until the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had time to consider what action it should take concerning the drugs, and to initiate legal action, if appropriate. Drugs that FDA orders detained may not be used, moved, altered, or tampered with in any manner by any person during the detention period, except as authorized under paragraph (h) of this section, until FDA terminates the detention order under paragraph (j) of this section, or the detention period expires, whichever occurs first.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Criteria for ordering detention.</I> Administrative detention of drugs may be ordered in accordance with this section when an authorized FDA representative, during an inspection under section 704 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, has reason to believe that a drug, as defined in section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, is adulterated or misbranded.
</P>
<P/>
<P>(c) <I>Detention period.</I> The detention is to be for a reasonable period that may not exceed 20 calendar days after the detention order is issued, unless the FDA Division Director in whose division the drugs are located determines that a greater period is required to seize the drugs, to institute injunction proceedings, or to evaluate the need for legal action, in which case the Division Director may authorize detention for 10 additional calendar days. The additional 10-calendar-day detention period may be ordered at the time the detention order is issued or at any time thereafter. The entire detention period may not exceed 30 calendar days, except when the detention period is extended under paragraph (g)(6) of this section. An authorized FDA representative may, in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section, terminate a detention before the expiration of the detention period.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Issuance of detention order.</I> (1) The detention order must be issued in writing, in the form of a detention notice, signed by the authorized FDA representative who has reason to believe that the drugs are adulterated or misbranded, and issued to the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the place where the drugs are located. If the owner or the user of the drugs is different from the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the place where the drugs are detained, a copy of the detention order must be provided to the owner or user of the drugs if the owner's or user's identity can be readily determined.
</P>
<P>(2) If detention of drugs in a vehicle or other carrier is ordered, a copy of the detention order must be provided to the shipper of record and the owner of the vehicle or other carrier, if their identities can be readily determined.
</P>
<P>(3) The detention order must include the following information:
</P>
<P>(i) A statement that the drugs identified in the order are detained for the period shown;
</P>
<P>(ii) A brief, general statement of the reasons for the detention;
</P>
<P>(iii) The location of the drugs;
</P>
<P>(iv) A statement that these drugs are not to be used, moved, altered, or tampered with in any manner during that period, except as permitted under paragraph (h) of this section, without the written permission of an authorized FDA representative;
</P>
<P>(v) Identification of the detained drugs;
</P>
<P>(vi) The detention order number;
</P>
<P>(vii) The date and hour of the detention order;
</P>
<P>(viii) The period of the detention;
</P>
<P>(ix) The text of section 304(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section;
</P>
<P>(x) A statement that any informal hearing on an appeal of a detention order must be conducted as a regulatory hearing under part 16 of this chapter, with certain exceptions described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section; and
</P>
<P> 
</P>
<P>(xi) The mailing address, telephone number, and name of the FDA Division Director.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Approval of detention order.</I> A detention order, before issuance, must be approved by the FDA Division Director in whose division the drugs are located. If prior written approval is not feasible, prior oral approval must be obtained and confirmed by written memorandum within FDA as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Labeling or marking a detained drug.</I> An FDA representative issuing a detention order under paragraph (d) of this section must label or mark the drugs with official FDA tags that include the following information:
</P>
<P>(1) A statement that the drugs are detained by the U.S. Government in accordance with section 304(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 334(g)).
</P>
<P>(2) A statement that the drugs must not be used, moved, altered, or tampered with in any manner for the period shown, without the written permission of an authorized FDA representative, except as authorized in paragraph (h) of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) A statement that the violation of a detention order or the removal or alteration of the tag is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both (section 303 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 333)).
</P>
<P>(4) The detention order number, the date and hour of the detention order, the detention period, and the name of the FDA representative who issued the detention order.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Appeal of a detention order.</I> (1) A person who would be entitled to claim the drugs, if seized, may appeal a detention order. Any appeal must be submitted in writing to the FDA Division Director in whose division the drugs are located within 5 working days of receipt of a detention order. If the appeal includes a request for an informal hearing, as defined in section 201(x) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(x)), the appellant must request either that a hearing be held within 5 working days after the appeal is filed or that the hearing be held at a later date, which must not be later than 20 calendar days after receipt of a detention order.
</P>
<P>(2) The appellant of a detention order must state the ownership or proprietary interest the appellant has in the detained drugs. If the detained drugs are located at a place other than an establishment owned or operated by the appellant, the appellant must include documents showing that the appellant would have legitimate authority to claim the drugs if seized.
</P>
<P>(3) Any informal hearing on an appeal of a detention order must be conducted as a regulatory hearing under regulation in accordance with part 16 of this chapter, except that:
</P>
<P>(i) The detention order under paragraph (d) of this section, rather than the notice under § 16.22(a) of this chapter, provides notice of opportunity for a hearing under this section and is part of the administrative record of the regulatory hearing under § 16.80(a) of this chapter;
</P>
<P>(ii) A request for a hearing under this section should be addressed to the FDA Division Director;
</P>
<P>(iii) The last sentence of § 16.24(e) of this chapter, stating that a hearing may not be required to be held at a time less than 2 working days after receipt of the request for a hearing, does not apply to a hearing under this section;
</P>
<P>(iv) Paragraph (g)(4) of this section, rather than § 16.42(a) of this chapter, describes the FDA employees who preside at hearings under this section.
</P>
<P>(4) The presiding officer of a regulatory hearing on an appeal of a detention order, who also must decide the appeal, must be an Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Director or another FDA official senior to an FDA Division Director who is permitted by § 16.42(a) of this chapter to preside over the hearing.
</P>
<P>(5) If the appellant requests a regulatory hearing and requests that the hearing be held within 5 working days after the appeal is filed, the presiding officer must, within 5 working days, hold the hearing and render a decision affirming or revoking the detention.
</P>
<P>(6) If the appellant requests a regulatory hearing and requests that the hearing be held at a date later than within 5 working days after the appeal is filed, but not later than 20 calendar days after receipt of a detention order, the presiding officer must hold the hearing at a date agreed upon by FDA and the appellant. The presiding officer must decide whether to affirm or revoke the detention within 5 working days after the conclusion of the hearing. The detention period extends to the date of the decision even if the 5-working-day period for making the decision extends beyond the otherwise applicable 20-calendar-day or 30-calendar-day detention period.
</P>
<P>(7) If the appellant appeals the detention order but does not request a regulatory hearing, the presiding officer must render a decision on the appeal, affirming or revoking the detention within 5 working days after the filing of the appeal.
</P>
<P>(8) If the presiding officer affirms a detention order, the drugs continue to be detained until FDA terminates the detention under paragraph (j) of this section or the detention period expires, whichever occurs first.
</P>
<P>(9) If the presiding officer revokes a detention order, FDA must terminate the detention under paragraph (j) of this section.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Movement of detained drugs.</I> (1) Except as provided in this paragraph, no person may move detained drugs within or from the place where they have been ordered detained until FDA terminates the detention under paragraph (j) of this section or the detention period expires, whichever occurs first.
</P>
<P>(2) If detained drugs are not in final form for shipment, the manufacturer may move them within the establishment where they are detained to complete the work needed to put them in final form. As soon as the drugs are moved for the purpose in the preceding sentence, the individual responsible for their movement must orally notify the FDA representative who issued the detention order, or another responsible division office official, of the movement of the drugs. As soon as the drugs are put in final form, they must be segregated from other drugs, and the individual responsible for their movement must orally notify the FDA representative who issued the detention order, or another responsible division office official, of their new location. The drugs put in final form must not be moved further without FDA approval.
</P>
<P>(3) The FDA representative who issued the detention order, or another responsible division office official, may approve, in writing, the movement of detained drugs for any of the following purposes:
</P>
<P>(i) To prevent interference with an establishment's operations or harm to the drugs;
</P>
<P>(ii) To destroy the drugs;
</P>
<P>(iii) To bring the drugs into compliance;
</P>
<P>(iv) For any other purpose that the FDA representative who issued the detention order, or other responsible division office official, believes is appropriate in the case.
</P>
<P>(4) If an FDA representative approves the movement of detained drugs under paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the detained drugs must remain segregated from other drugs and the person responsible for their movement must immediately orally notify the official who approved the movement of the drugs, or another responsible FDA division office official, of the new location of the detained drugs.
</P>
<P>(5) Unless otherwise permitted by the FDA representative who is notified of, or who approves, the movement of drugs under this paragraph, the required tags must accompany the drugs during and after movement and must remain with the drugs until FDA terminates the detention or the detention period expires, whichever occurs first.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Actions involving adulterated or misbranded drugs.</I> If FDA determines that the detained drugs, including any that have been put in final form, are adulterated or misbranded, or both, it may initiate legal action against the drugs or the responsible individuals, or both, or request that the drugs be destroyed or otherwise brought into compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act under FDA's supervision.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Detention termination.</I> If FDA decides to terminate a detention or when the detention period expires, whichever occurs first, an FDA representative authorized to terminate a detention will issue a detention termination notice releasing the drugs to any person who received the original detention order or that person's representative and will remove, or authorize in writing the removal of, the required labels or tags.
</P>
<P>(k) <I>Recordkeeping requirements.</I> (1) After issuance of a detention order under paragraph (d) of this section, the owner, operator, or agent in charge of any factory, warehouse, other establishment, or consulting laboratory where detained drugs are manufactured, processed, packed, or held, must have, or establish, and maintain adequate records relating to how the detained drugs may have become adulterated or misbranded, records on any distribution of the drugs before and after the detention period, records on the correlation of any in-process detained drugs that are put in final form under paragraph (h) of this section to the completed drugs, records of any changes in, or processing of, the drugs permitted under the detention order, and records of any other movement under paragraph (h) of this section. Records required under this paragraph must be provided to FDA on request for review and copying. Any FDA request for access to records required under this paragraph must be made at a reasonable time, must state the reason or purpose for the request, and must identify to the fullest extent practicable the information or type of information sought in the records to which access is requested.
</P>
<P>(2) Records required under this paragraph must be maintained for a maximum period of 2 years after the issuance of the detention order or for such other shorter period as FDA directs. When FDA terminates the detention or when the detention period expires, whichever occurs first, FDA will advise all persons required under this paragraph to keep records concerning that detention whether further recordkeeping is required for the remainder of the 2-year, or shorter, period. FDA ordinarily will not require further recordkeeping if the Agency determines that the drugs are not adulterated or misbranded or that recordkeeping is not necessary to protect the public health, unless the records are required under other regulations in this chapter (e.g., the good manufacturing practice regulation in part 211 of this chapter).

</P>
<P>(ii) The number of calories, if declared, and the quantitative amount by weight per serving of each dietary ingredient required to be listed under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall be presented either in a separate column aligned to the right of the column of names or immediately following the listing of names within the same column. The quantitative amounts by weight shall represent the weight of the dietary ingredient rather than the weight of the source of the dietary ingredient (e.g., the weight of calcium rather than that of calcium carbonate).
</P>
<P>(A) The amounts shall be expressed in the increments specified in § 101.9(c)(1) through (7), which includes increments for sodium.
</P>
<P>(B) The amounts of vitamins and minerals, excluding sodium, shall be the amount of the vitamin or mineral included in one serving of the product, using the units of measurement and the levels of significance given in § 101.9(c)(8)(iv), except that zeros following decimal points may be dropped, and additional levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient to express lower amounts (<I>e.g.,</I> the RDI for zinc is given in whole milligrams (mg), but the quantitative amount may be declared in tenths of a mg). The amount of vitamin D may, but is not required to, be expressed in IUs, in addition to the mandatory declaration in mcg. Any declaration of the amount of vitamin D in IUs must appear in parentheses after the declaration of the amount of vitamin D in mcg.
</P>
<P>(iii) The percent of the Daily Value of all dietary ingredients declared under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall be listed, except that the percent Daily Value for protein, when present, shall be calculated using the corrected amount of protein as specified in § 101.9(c)(7)(ii); no percent of the Daily Value shall be given for subcomponents for which DRVs or RDIs have not been established (<I>e.g.,</I> total sugars). Additionally, the percentage of the RDI for protein shall be omitted when a food is purported to be for infants through 12 months of age.
</P>
<P>(A) When information on the percent of Daily Values is listed, this information shall be presented in one column aligned under the heading of “% Daily Value” and to the right of the column of amounts. The headings “% Daily Value (DV),” “% DV,” “Percent Daily Value,” or “Percent DV” may be substituted for “% Daily Value.” The heading “% Daily Value” shall be placed on the same line as the heading “Amount Per Serving.” When the acronym “DV” is unexplained in the heading and a footnote is required under (b)(2)(iii)(D), (b)(2)(iii)(F), or (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the footnote shall explain the acronym (e.g. “Daily Value (DV) not established”). 
</P>
<P>(B) The percent of Daily Value shall be calculated by dividing the quantitative amount by weight of each (b)(2)-dietary ingredient by the RDI as established in § 101.9(c)(8)(iv) or the DRV as established in § 101.9(c)(9) for the specified dietary ingredient and multiplying by 100, except that the percent of Daily Value for protein, when present, shall be calculated as specified in § 101.9(c)(7)(ii). The quantitative amount by weight of each dietary ingredient in this calculation shall be the unrounded amount, except that for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, potassium, total carbohydrate, and dietary fiber, the quantitative amount by weight declared on the label (i.e., rounded amount) may be used. The numerical value shall be followed by the symbol for percent (i.e., %).
</P>
<P>(C) The percentages based on RDI's and on DRV's shall be expressed to the nearest whole percent, except that for dietary ingredients for which DRV's have been established, “Less than 1%” or “&lt;1%” shall be used to declare the “% Daily Value” when the quantitative amount of the dietary ingredient by weight is great enough to require that the dietary ingredient be listed, but the amount is so small that the “% Daily Value” when rounded to the nearest percent is zero (e.g., a product that contains 1 gram of total carbohydrate would list the percent Daily Value as “Less than 1%” or “&lt;1%”). 
</P>
<P>(D) If the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein, or added sugars, a symbol shall follow the value listed for those nutrients that refers to the same symbol that is placed at the bottom of the nutrition label, below the bar required under paragraph (e)(6) of this section and inside the box, that is followed by the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.” If the product is represented or purported to be for use by children 1 through 3 years of age, and if the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein, or added sugars, a symbol shall follow the value listed for those nutrients that refers to the same symbol that is placed at the bottom of the nutrition label, below the bar required under paragraph (e)(6) of this section and inside the box, that is followed by the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 1,000 calorie diet.”
</P>
<P>(E) The percent of Daily Value shall be based on RDI or DRV values for adults and children 4 or more years of age, unless the product is represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age, children 1 through 3 years of age, pregnant women, or lactating women, in which case the column heading shall clearly state the intended group. If the product is for persons within more than one group, the percent of Daily Value for each group shall be presented in separate columns as shown in paragraph (e)(11)(ii) of this section.
</P>
<P>(F) For declared subcomponents that have no DRVs or RDIs, a symbol (<I>e.g.,</I> an asterisk) shall be placed in the “Percent Daily Value” column that shall refer to the same symbol that is placed at the bottom of the nutrition label, below the last heavy bar and inside the box, and followed by a statement “Daily Value not established.”
</P>
<P>(G) When calories or calories from saturated fat are declared, the space under the “% DV” column shall be left blank for these items. When there are no other (b)(2)-dietary ingredients listed for which a value must be declared in the “% DV” column, the column may be omitted as shown in paragraph (e)(11)(vii) of this section. When the “% DV” column is not required, but the dietary ingredients listed are subject to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(F) of this section, the symbol required in that paragraph shall immediately follow the quantitative amount by weight for each dietary ingredient listed under “Amount Per Serving.”
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Information on dietary ingredients for which RDI's and DRV's have not been established.</I> (i) Dietary ingredients for which FDA has not established RDI's or DRV's and that are not subject to regulation under paragraph (b)(2) of this section (hereinafter referred to as “other dietary ingredients”) shall be declared by their common or usual name when they are present in a dietary supplement, in a column that is under the column of names described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section or, as long as the constituents of an other dietary ingredient are not listed, in a linear display, under the heavy bar described in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, except that if no (b)(2)-dietary ingredients are declared, other dietary ingredients shall be declared directly beneath the heading “Amount Per Serving” described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section. 
</P>
<P>(ii) The quantitative amount by weight per serving of other dietary ingredients shall be presented in the same manner as the corresponding information required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section or, when a linear display is used, shall be presented immediately following the name of the other dietary ingredient. The quantitative amount by weight shall be the weight of the other dietary ingredient listed and not the weight of any component, or the source, of that dietary ingredient. 
</P>
<P>(A) These amounts shall be expressed using metric measures in appropriate units.
</P>
<P>(B) For any dietary ingredient that is a liquid extract from which the solvent has not been removed, the quantity listed shall be the volume or weight of the total extract. Information on the condition of the starting material shall be indicated when it is fresh and may be indicated when it is dried. Information may be included on the concentration of the dietary ingredient and the solvent used, e.g., “fresh dandelion root extract, x (y:z) in 70% ethanol,” where x is the number of milliliters (mL) or mg of the entire extract, y is the weight of the starting material and z is the volume (mL) of solvent. Where the solvent has been partially removed (not to dryness), the final concentration, when indicated, shall be stated (e.g., if the original extract was 1:5 and 50 percent of the solvent was removed, then the final concentration shall be stated as 1:2.5). Where the name of the solvent used is not included in the nutrition label, it is required to be listed in the ingredient statement in accordance with § 101.4(g).
</P>
<P>(C) For a dietary ingredient that is an extract from which the solvent has been removed, the weight of the ingredient shall be the weight of the dried extract.
</P>
<P>(iii) The constituents of a dietary ingredient described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section may be listed indented under the dietary ingredient and followed by their quantitative amounts by weight per serving, except that dietary ingredients described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be listed in accordance with that section. When the constituents of a dietary ingredient described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section are listed, all other dietary ingredients shall be declared in a column; however, the constituents themselves may be declared in a column or in a linear display.
</P>
<P>(iv) Other dietary ingredients shall bear a symbol (e.g., an asterisk) in the column under the heading of “% Daily Value” that refers to the same symbol placed at the bottom of the nutrition label and followed by the statement “Daily Value not established,” except that when the heading “% Daily Value” is not used, the symbol shall follow the quantitative amount by weight for each dietary ingredient listed. 
</P>
<P>(c) A proprietary blend of dietary ingredients shall be included in the list of dietary ingredients described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section and identified by the term “Proprietary Blend” or other appropriately descriptive term or fanciful name and may be highlighted by bold type. Except as specified in this paragraph, all other requirements for the listing of dietary ingredients in dietary supplements are applicable.
</P>
<P>(1) Dietary ingredients contained in the proprietary blend that are listed under paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be declared in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) Dietary ingredients contained in the proprietary blend that are listed under paragraph (b)(3) of this section (i.e., “other dietary ingredients”) shall be declared in descending order of predominance by weight, in a column or linear fashion, and indented under the term “Proprietary Blend” or other appropriately descriptive term or fanciful name. 
</P>
<P>(3) The quantitative amount by weight specified for the proprietary blend shall be the total weight of all other dietary ingredients contained in the proprietary blend and shall be placed on the same line to the right of the term “Proprietary Blend” or other appropriately descriptive term or fanciful name underneath the column of amounts described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. A symbol (e.g., asterisk), which refers to the same symbol placed at the bottom of the nutrition label that is followed by the statement “Daily Value not established,” shall be placed under the heading “% Daily Value,” if present, or immediately following the quantitative amount by weight for the proprietary blend. 
</P>
<P>(4) The sample label shown in paragraph (e)(11)(v) of this section illustrates one method of nutrition labeling a proprietary blend of dietary ingredients.
</P>
<P>(d) The source ingredient that supplies a dietary ingredient may be identified within the nutrition label in parentheses immediately following or indented beneath the name of a dietary ingredient and preceded by the words “as” or “from”, e.g., “Calcium (as calcium carbonate),” except that manner of presentation is unnecessary when the name of the dietary ingredient (e.g., Oriental ginseng) or its synonym (e.g., ascorbic acid) is itself the source ingredient. When a source ingredient is identified in parentheses within the nutrition label, or when the name of the dietary ingredient or its synonym is the source ingredient, it shall not be required to be listed again in the ingredient statement that appears outside of the nutrition label. When a source ingredient is not identified within the nutrition label, it shall be listed in an ingredient statement in accordance with § 101.4(g), which shall appear outside and immediately below the nutrition label or, if there is insufficient space below the nutrition label, immediately contiguous and to the right of the nutrition label.
</P>
<P>(1) Source ingredients shall be identified in accordance with § 101.4 (i.e., shall be listed by common or usual name, and the listing of botanicals shall specify the part of the plant from which the ingredient is derived) regardless of whether they are listed in an ingredient statement or in the nutrition label.
</P>
<P>(2) When source ingredients are listed within the nutrition label, and two or more are used to provide a single dietary ingredient, all of the sources shall be listed within the parentheses in descending order by weight.
</P>
<P>(3) Representations that the source ingredient conforms to an official compendium may be included either in the nutrition label or in the ingredient list (e.g., “Calcium (as calcium carbonate USP)”). 
</P>
<P>(e) Except as provided for small and intermediate sized packages under paragraph (h)(3)(i)(2) of this section, information other than the title, headings, and footnotes shall be in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. Type size no smaller than 6 point may be used for column headings (<I>e.g.,</I> “Amount Per Serving” and “% Daily Value”) and for footnotes (<I>e.g.,</I> “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet”).
</P>
<P>(1) The title, “Supplement Facts,” shall be set in a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label and, unless impractical, shall be set full width of the nutrition label. The title and all headings shall be bolded to distinguish them from other information. 
</P>
<P>(2) The nutrition information shall be enclosed in a box by using hairlines.
</P>
<P>(3) All information within the nutrition label shall utilize:
</P>
<P>(i) A single easy-to-read type style, 
</P>
<P>(ii) All black or one color type, printed on a white or other neutral contrasting background whenever practical,
</P>
<P>(iii) Upper- and lowercase letters, except that all uppercase lettering may be utilized for packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches,
</P>
<P>(iv) At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text), and
</P>
<P>(v) Letters that do not touch.
</P>
<P>(4) Except as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages under paragraph (i)(2) of this section, information other than the title, headings, and footnotes shall be in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. Type size no smaller than 6 point may be used for column headings (e.g., “Amount Per Serving” and “% Daily Value”) and for footnotes (e.g., “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet”). 
</P>
<P>(5) A hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text shall separate each dietary ingredient required in paragraph (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it, as shown in paragraph (e)(10) of this section.
</P>
<P>(6) A heavy bar shall be placed:
</P>
<P>(i) Beneath the subheading “Servings Per Container” except that if “Servings Per Container” is not required and, as a result, not declared, the bar shall be placed beneath the subheading “Serving Size,”
</P>
<P>(ii) Beneath the last dietary ingredient to be listed under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, if any, and
</P>
<P>(iii) Beneath the last other dietary ingredient to be listed under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if any.
</P>
<P>(7) A light bar shall be placed beneath the headings “Amount Per Serving” and “% Daily Value.”
</P>
<P>(8) If the product contains two or more separately packaged dietary supplements that differ from each other (<I>e.g.,</I> the product has a packet of supplements to be taken in the morning and a different packet to be taken in the afternoon), the quantitative amounts and percent of Daily Value may be presented as specified in this paragraph in individual nutrition labels or in one aggregate nutrition label as illustrated in paragraph (e)(11)(iii) of this section.
</P>
<P>(9)(i) The quantitative amount by weight (or volume, if permitted) and the percent of Daily Value of each dietary ingredient may be presented on a “per unit” basis in addition to the “per serving” basis required by paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section for (b)(2)-dietary ingredients and (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(3)(iv) of this section for other dietary ingredients. If “per unit” information is provided, it must be presented in additional columns to the right of the “per serving” information and be clearly identified by appropriate headings.
</P>
<P>(ii) Alternatively, if a recommendation is made in other parts of the label that a dietary supplement be consumed more than once per day, the total quantitative amount by weight (or volume, if permitted) and the percent of Daily Value of each dietary ingredient may be presented on a “per day” basis in addition to the “per serving” basis required by paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section for (b)(2)-dietary ingredients and (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(3)(iv) of this section for other dietary ingredients. If “per day” information is provided, it must be presented in additional columns to the right of the “per serving” information and be clearly identified by appropriate headings and/or be presented in a parenthetical statement as part of the “Serving Size” declaration. A sample illustration for “per day” information in a column format is provided in paragraph (e)(11)(viii) of this section. As illustrated, the additional “Per Day” column heading is followed parenthetically by the number of servings recommended per day in other parts of the label (e.g., “Per Day (3 Caplets)”). When the parenthetical statement format following the “Serving Size” declaration is used as an alternative to the column format, the statement must provide no more than simple instructions regarding how to calculate the “per day” amount for the number of servings per day recommended in other parts of the label (e.g., “Serving Size: 1 Caplet (Multiply amounts by 3 for total daily amount)”). When the parenthetical statement format following the “Serving Size” declaration is used in addition to the column format, the statement must provide no more than a simple declaration of the number of servings recommended in other parts of the label (e.g., “Serving Size: 1 Caplet (Total daily amount: 3 caplets per day)”).
</P>
<P>(10) In the interest of uniformity of presentation, FDA urges that the information be presented using the graphic specifications set forth in appendix B to part 101, as applicable. 
</P>
<P>(11) The following sample labels are presented for the purpose of illustration: 
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er27my16.413.gif"/>
<P>(ii) Multiple vitamins for children and adults (excludes Servings Per Container which is stated in the net quantity of contents declaration):
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er21de18.014.gif"/>
<img src="/graphics/er27my16.415.gif"/>
<P>(iv) Dietary supplement containing dietary ingredients with and without RDIs and DRVs:

</P>
<img src="/graphics/er21de18.015.gif"/>
<img src="/graphics/er27my16.417.gif"/>
<img src="/graphics/er27my16.418.gif"/>
<img src="/graphics/er27my16.419.gif"/>
<img src="/graphics/er25mr22.000.gif"/>
<P>(12) If space is not adequate to list the required information as shown in the sample labels in paragraph (e)(11) of this section, the list may be split and continued to the right as long as the headings are repeated. The list to the right must be set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the dietary ingredients and percent of Daily Value information given to the left. The following sample label illustrates this display:
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er21de18.016.gif"/>
<P>(f)(1) Compliance with this section will be determined in accordance with § 101.9(g)(1) through (g)(8), (g)(10), and (g)(11), except that the sample for analysis shall consist of a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller, randomly selected to be representative of the lot. The criteria on class I and class II nutrients given in § 101.9(g)(3) and (g)(4) also are applicable to other dietary ingredients described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Reasonable excesses over labeled amounts are acceptable within current good manufacturing practice.
</P>
<P>(2) When it is not technologically feasible, or some other circumstance makes it impracticable, for firms to comply with the requirements of this section, FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to deal with the situation in accordance with § 101.9(g)(9). Firms in need of such special allowances shall make their request in writing to the Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740.
</P>
<P>(g) Except as provided in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(5) of this section, the location of nutrition information on a label shall be in compliance with § 101.2.
</P>
<P>(h) Dietary supplements are subject to the exemptions specified as follows in:

<HEAD>§ 101.42   Nutrition labeling of raw fruit, vegetables, and fish.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) urges food retailers to provide nutrition information, as provided in § 101.9(c), for raw fruit, vegetables, and fish at the point-of-purchase. If retailers choose to provide such information, they should do so in a manner that conforms to the guidelines in § 101.45.
</P>
<P>(b) In § 101.44, FDA has listed the 20 varieties of raw fruit, vegetables, and fish that are most frequently consumed during a year and to which the guidelines apply.
</P>
<P>(c) FDA has also defined in § 101.43, the circumstances that constitute substantial compliance by food retailers with the guidelines.
</P>
<P>(d) By May 8, 1993, FDA will issue a report on actions taken by food retailers to provide consumers with nutrition information for raw fruit, vegetables, and fish under the guidelines established in § 101.45.
</P>
<P>(1) The report will include a determination of whether there is substantial compliance, as defined in § 101.43, with the guidelines.
</P>
<P>(2) In evaluating substantial compliance, FDA will consider only the 20 varieties of raw fruit, vegetables, and fish most frequently consumed as identified in § 101.44.
</P>
<P>(e) If FDA finds that there is substantial compliance with the guidelines for the nutrition labeling of raw fruit and vegetables or of fish, the agency will so state in the report, and the guidelines will remain in effect. FDA will reevaluate the market place for substantial compliance every 2 years.
</P>
<P>(f) If FDA determines that there is not substantial compliance with the guidelines for raw fruit and vegetables or for raw fish, the agency will at that time issue proposed regulations requiring that any person who offers raw fruit and vegetables or fish to consumers provide, in a manner prescribed by regulations, the nutrition information required by § 101.9. Final regulations would have to be issued 6 months after issuance of proposed regulations, and they would become effective 6 months after the date of their promulgation.

<HEAD>§ 101.43   Substantial compliance of food retailers with the guidelines for the voluntary nutrition labeling of raw fruit, vegetables, and fish.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will judge a food retailer who sells raw agricultural commodities or raw fish to be in compliance with the guidelines in § 101.45 with respect to raw agricultural commodities if the retailer displays or provides nutrition labeling for at least 90 percent of the raw agricultural commodities listed in § 101.44 that it sells, and with respect to raw fish if the retailer displays or provides nutrition labeling for at least 90 percent of the types of raw fish listed in § 101.44 that it sells. To be in compliance, the nutrition labeling shall:
</P>
<P>(1) Be presented in the store or other type of establishment in a manner that is consistent with § 101.45(a)(1);
</P>
<P>(2) Be presented in content and format that are consistent with § 101.45 (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4); and
</P>
<P>(3) Include data that have been provided by FDA in appendices C and D to part 101 of this chapter, except that the information on potassium is voluntary.
</P>
<P>(b) To determine whether there is substantial compliance by food retailers with the guidelines in § 101.45 for the voluntary nutrition labeling of raw fruit and vegetables and of raw fish, FDA will select a representative sample of 2,000 stores, allocated by store type and size, for raw fruit and vegetables and for raw fish.
</P>
<P>(c) FDA will find that there is substantial compliance with the guidelines in § 101.45 if it finds based on paragraph (a) of this section that at least 60 percent of all stores that are evaluated are in compliance.
</P>
<P>(d) FDA will evaluate substantial compliance separately for raw agricultural commodities and for raw fish.

<HEAD>§ 101.45   Guidelines for the voluntary nutrition labeling of raw fruits, vegetables, and fish.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Nutrition labeling for raw fruits, vegetables, and fish listed in § 101.44 should be presented to the public in the following manner:
</P>
<P>(1) Nutrition labeling information should be displayed at the point of purchase by an appropriate means such as by a label affixed to the food or through labeling including shelf labels, signs, posters, brochures, notebooks, or leaflets that are readily available and in close proximity to the foods. The nutrition labeling information may also be supplemented by a video, live demonstration, or other media.
</P>
<P>(2) Serving sizes should be determined, and nutrients declared, in accordance with § 101.9 (b) and (c), respectively, except that the nutrition labeling data should be based on the raw edible portion for fruits and vegetables and on the cooked edible portion for fish. The methods used to cook fish should be those that do not add fat, breading, or seasoning (e.g., salt or spices).
</P>
<P>(3) When nutrition labeling information is provided for more than one raw fruit, vegetable, or fish on signs, posters, brochures, notebooks, or leaflets, it may be presented in charts with horizontal or vertical columns or as a compilation of individual nutrition labels. Nutrition labeling that is presented in a linear display (see § 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(<I>2</I>)) will not be considered to be in compliance. The heading “Nutrition Facts” must be in a type size larger than all other print in the nutrition label. The required information (i.e., headings, serving sizes, list of nutrients, quantitative amounts by weight (except for vitamins and minerals), and percent of Daily Values (DV's) (except for sugars and protein) must be clearly presented and of sufficient type size and color contrast to be plainly legible, with numeric values for percent of DV highlighted in contrast to the quantitative amounts by weight and hairlines between all nutrients.
</P>
<P>(i) Declaration of the number of servings per container need not be included in the nutrition labeling of raw fruits, vegetables, and fish.
</P>
<P>(ii) Except for the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet,” the footnote required in § 101.9(d)(9) is not required. However, when labeling is provided in brochures, notebooks, leaflets, or similar types of materials, retailers are encouraged to include the footnote.
</P>
<P>(iii) When retailers provide nutrition labeling information for more than one raw fruit or vegetable on signs or posters or in brochures, notebooks, or leaflets, the listings for saturated fat, <I>trans</I> fat, and cholesterol may be omitted from the charts or individual nutrition labels if a footnote states that most fruits and vegetables provide negligible amounts of these nutrients, but that avocados contain 0.5 gram (g) of saturated fat per ounce (e.g., “Most fruits and vegetables provide negligible amounts of saturated fat, <I>trans</I> fat, and cholesterol; avocados provide 0.5 g of saturated fat per ounce”). The footnote also may contain information about the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat content of avocados.
</P>
<P>(iv) When retailers provide nutrition labeling information for more than one raw fish on signs or posters or in brochures, notebooks, or leaflets, the listings for <I>trans</I> fat, dietary fiber, and sugars may be omitted from the charts or individual nutrition labels if the following footnote is used, “Fish provide negligible amounts of <I>trans</I> fat, dietary fiber, and sugars.”
</P>
<P>(4) When nutrition labeling is provided for individual raw fruits, vegetables, or fish on packages or on signs, posters, brochures, notebooks, or leaflets, it should be displayed in accordance with § 101.9, except that the declaration of the number of servings per container need not be included. For individual labels provided by retailers on signs and posters, the footnote required in § 101.9(d)(9) may be shortened to “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.”
</P>
<P>(b) Nutrition label values provided by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Appendices C and D to part 101 for the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruits, vegetables, and fish listed in § 101.44 shall be used to ensure uniformity in declared values. FDA will publish proposed updates of the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruits, vegetables, and fish and nutrition label data for these foods (or a notice that the data sets have not changed from the previous publication) at least every 4 years in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
</P>
<P>(1) The agency encourages the submission of data bases with new or additional nutrient data for any of the most frequently consumed raw fruits, vegetables, and fish to the Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling (HFS-800), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, for review and evaluation. FDA may incorporate these data in the next revision of the nutrition labeling information for the top 20 raw fruits, vegetables, and fish.
</P>
<P>(i) Guidance in the development of data bases may be found in the “FDA Nutrition Labeling Manual: A Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases,” available from the Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling (HFS-800), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740.
</P>
<P>(ii) The submission to FDA should include, but need not be limited to, information on the following: Source of the data (names of investigators, name of organization, place of analyses, dates of analyses), number of samples, sampling design, analytical methods, and statistical treatment of the data. Proposed quantitative label declarations may be included. The proposed values for declaration should be determined in accordance with the “FDA Nutrition Labeling Manual: A Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases.”
</P>
<P>(2) [Reserved]
</P>
<P>(c) Data bases of nutrient values for raw fruits, vegetables, and fish that are not among the 20 most frequently consumed may be used to develop nutrition labeling values for these foods. This includes data bases of nutrient values for specific varieties, species, or cultivars of raw fruits, vegetables, and fish not specifically identified among the 20 most frequently consumed.
</P>
<P>(1) The food names and descriptions for the fruits, vegetables, and fish should clearly identify these foods as distinct from foods among the most frequently consumed list for which FDA has provided data.
</P>
<P>(2) Guidance in the development of data bases may be found in the “FDA Nutrition Labeling Manual: A Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases.”
</P>
<P>(3) Nutrition labeling values computed from data bases are subject to the compliance provisions of § 101.9(g).
</P>
<P>(i) Compliance with the provisions of § 101.9(g) may be achieved by use of a data base that has been developed following FDA guideline procedures and approved by FDA.
</P>
<P>(A) The submission to FDA for approval should include but need not be limited to information on the following: Source of the data (names of investigators, name of organization, place of analyses, dates of analyses), number of samples, sampling design, analytical methods, statistical treatment of the data, and proposed quantitative label declarations. The values for declaration should be determined in accordance with the “FDA Nutrition Labeling Manual: A Guide for Developing and Using Databases.”
</P>
<P>(B) FDA approval of a data base and nutrition labeling values shall not be considered granted until the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition has agreed to all aspects of the data base in writing. Approvals will be in effect for a limited time, e.g., 10 years, and will be eligible for renewal in the absence of significant changes in agricultural or industry practices (e.g., a change occurs in a predominant variety produced). FDA will take steps to revoke its approval of the data base and nutrition labeling values if FDA monitoring suggests that the data base or nutrition labeling values are no longer representative of the item sold in this country. Approval requests shall be submitted in accordance with the provision of § 101.30 of this chapter.

</P>
<P>(2) The terms defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be used on the label and in the labeling of meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:
</P>
<P>(i) The product contains a food that meets the definition of “high” in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
</P>
<P>(ii) The label or labeling clearly identifies the food that is the subject of the claim (e.g., the serving of broccoli in this product is high in vitamin C).
</P>
<P>(c) <I>“Good Source” claims.</I> (1) The terms “good source,” “contains,” or “provides” may be used on the label and in the labeling of foods, except meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that the food contains 10 to 19 percent of the RDI or the DRV per reference amount customarily consumed.
</P>
<P>(2) The terms defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be used on the label and in the labeling of meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in 101.13(m), provided that:

</P>
<P>(2) The disclosure shall appear in immediate proximity to such claim, be in a type size no less than one-half the size of the claim and precede any disclosure statement required under § 101.13(h) (e.g., “contains [<I>x amount</I>] of total fat per serving. See nutrition information for fat content”).
</P>
<P>(e) <I>“More” claims.</I> (1) A relative claim using the terms “more,” “fortified,” “enriched,” “added,” “extra,” and “plus” may be used on the label or in labeling of foods to describe the level of protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, or potassium, except as limited by § 101.13(j)(1)(i) and except meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:
</P>
<P>(i) The food contains at least 10 percent more of the RDI for vitamins or minerals or of the DRV for protein, dietary fiber, or potassium (expressed as a percent of the Daily Value) per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference food; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Where the claim is based on a nutrient that has been added to the food, that fortification is in accordance with the policy on fortification of foods in § 104.20 of this chapter; and
</P>
<P>(iii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:
</P>
<P>(A) The identity of the reference food and the percentage (or fraction) that the nutrient is greater relative to the RDI or DRV are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “contains 10 percent more of the Daily Value for fiber than white bread”); and
</P>
<P>(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per labeled serving with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., “Fiber content of white bread is 1 gram (g) per serving; (this product) 3.5 g per serving”) is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.
</P>
<P>(2) A relative claim using the terms “more,” “fortified,” “enriched,” “added,” “extra,” and “plus” may be used on the label or in labeling to describe the level of protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber or potassium, except as limited in § 101.13(j)(1)(i), in meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) or main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:
</P>
<P>(i) The food contains at least 10 percent more of the RDI for vitamins or minerals or of the DRV for protein, dietary fiber, or potassium (expressed as a percent of the Daily Value) per 100 g of food than an appropriate reference food.
</P>
<P>(ii) Where the claim is based on a nutrient that has been added to the food, that fortification is in accordance with the policy on fortification of foods in § 104.20 of this chapter; and
</P>
<P>(iii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:
</P>
<P>(A) The identity of the reference food and the percentage (or fraction) that the nutrient was increased relative to the RDI or DRV are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “contains 10 percent more of the Daily Value for fiber per 3 oz than does ‘X brand of product’ ”), and
</P>
<P>(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per specified weight with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., “The fiber content of ‘X brand of product’ is 2 g per 3 oz. This product contains 4.5 g per 3 oz.”) is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>“High potency” claims.</I> (1)(i) The term “high potency” may be used on the label or in the labeling of foods to describe individual vitamins or minerals that are present at 100 percent or more of the RDI per reference amount customarily consumed.
</P>
<P>(ii) When the term “high potency” is used to describe individual vitamins or minerals in a product that contains other nutrients or dietary ingredients, the label or labeling shall clearly identify which vitamin or mineral is described by the term “high potency” (e.g., “Botanical ‘X’ with high potency vitamin E”).
</P>
<P>(2) The term “high potency” may be used on the label or in the labeling of a multiingredient food product to describe the product if the product contains 100 percent or more of the RDI for at least two-thirds of the vitamins and minerals that are listed in § 101.9(c)(8)(iv) and that are present in the product at 2 percent or more of the RDI (e.g., “High potency multivitamin, multimineral dietary supplement tablets”).
</P>
<P>(3) Where compliance with paragraphs (f)(1)(i), (f)(1)(ii), or (f)(2) of this section is based on a nutrient that has been added to a food (other than a dietary supplement), that fortification shall be in accordance with the policy on fortification of foods in § 104.20 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Nutrient content claims using the term “antioxidant.”</I> A nutrient content claim that characterizes the level of antioxidant nutrients present in a food may be used on the label or in the labeling of that food when:
</P>
<P>(1) An RDI has been established for each of the nutrients;
</P>
<P>(2) The nutrients that are the subject of the claim have recognized antioxidant activity; that is, when there exists scientific evidence that, following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, the substance participates in physiological, biochemical, or cellular processes that inactivate free radicals or prevent free radical-initiated chemical reactions;
</P>
<P>(3) The level of each nutrient that is the subject of the claim is sufficient to qualify for the § 101.54 (b), (c), or (e) claim (e.g., to bear the claim ”high in antioxidant vitamin C,” the product must contain 20 percent or more of the RDI for vitamin C). Beta-carotene may be a subject of the claim when the level of vitamin A present as beta-carotene in the food that bears the claim is sufficient to qualify for the claim. For example, for the claim “good source of antioxidant beta-carotene,” 10 percent or more of the RDI for vitamin A must be present as beta-carotene per reference amount customarily consumed; and
</P>
<P>(4) The names of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim are included as part of the claim (e.g., “high in antioxidant vitamins C and E”). Alternatively, when used as part of a nutrient content claim, the term “antioxidant” or “antioxidants” (as in “high in antioxidants”) may be linked by a symbol (e.g., an asterisk) that refers to the same symbol that appears elsewhere on the same panel of a product label followed by the name or names of the nutrients with recognized antioxidant activity. The list of nutrients shall appear in letters of a type size height no smaller than the larger of one-half of the type size of the largest nutrient content claim or 
<FR>1/16</FR> inch.

<HEAD>§ 101.60   Nutrient content claims for the calorie content of foods.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General requirements.</I> A claim about the calorie or sugar content of a food may only be made on the label or in the labeling of a food if:
</P>
<P>(1) The claim uses one of the terms defined in this section in accordance with the definition for that term;
</P>
<P>(2) The claim is made in accordance with the general requirements for nutrient content claims in § 101.13;
</P>
<P>(3) The food for which the claim is made is labeled in accordance with § 101.9, § 101.10, or § 101.36, as applicable; and
</P>
<P>(4) For dietary supplements, claims regarding calories may not be made on products that meet the criteria in § 101.60(b)(1) or (b)(2) for “calorie free” or “low calorie” claims except when an equivalent amount of a similar dietary supplement (e.g., another protein supplement) that the labeled food resembles and for which it substitutes, normally exceeds the definition for “low calorie” in § 101.60(b)(2).
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Calorie content claims.</I> (1) The terms “calorie free,” “free of calories,” “no calories,” “zero calories,” “without calories,” “trivial source of calories,” “negligible source of calories,” or “dietarily insignificant source of calories” may be used on the label or in the labeling of foods, provided that:
</P>
<P>(i) The food contains less than 5 calories per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving.
</P>
<P>(ii) As required in § 101.13(e)(2), if the food meets this condition without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower the caloric content, it is labeled to disclose that calories are not usually present in the food (e.g., “cider vinegar, a calorie free food”).
</P>
<P>(2) The terms “low calorie,” “few calories,” “contains a small amount of calories,” “low source of calories,” or “low in calories” may be used on the label or in labeling of foods, except meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:
</P>
<P>(i)(A) The food has a reference amount customarily consumed greater than 30 grams (g) or greater than 2 tablespoons and does not provide more than 40 calories per reference amount customarily consumed; or
</P>
<P>(B) The food has a reference amount customarily consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less and does not provide more than 40 calories per reference amount customarily consumed and, except for sugar substitutes, per 50 g (for dehydrated foods that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant amount, as defined in § 101.9(f)(1), of all nutrients per reference amount customarily consumed, the per 50 g criterion refers to the “as prepared” form).
</P>
<P>(ii) If a food meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to vary the caloric content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all foods of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches (e.g., “celery, a low calorie food”).
</P>
<P>(3) The terms defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) or main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:
</P>
<P>(i) The product contains 120 calories or less per 100 g; and
</P>
<P>(ii) If the product meets this condition without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower the calorie content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all foods of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which it attaches.
</P>
<P>(4) The terms “reduced calorie,” “reduced in calories,” “calorie reduced,” “fewer calories,” “lower calorie,” or “lower in calories” may be used on the label or in the labeling of foods, except as limited by § 101.13(j)(1)(i) and except meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:
</P>
<P>(i) The food contains at least 25 percent fewer calories per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference food as described in § 101.13(j)(1); and
</P>
<P>(ii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:
</P>
<P>(A) The identity of the reference food and the percent (or fraction) that the calories differ between the two foods are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., reduced calorie cupcakes “33
<FR>1/3</FR> percent fewer calories than regular cupcakes”); and
</P>
<P>(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient per labeled serving size with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., “Calorie content has been reduced from 150 to 100 calories per serving.”) is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.
</P>
<P>(iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section may not be made on the label or labeling of foods if the reference food meets the definition for “low calorie.”
</P>
<P>(5) The terms defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be used on the label or in the labeling of meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:
</P>
<P>(i) The food contains at least 25 percent fewer calories per 100 g of food than an appropriate reference food as described in § 101.13(j)(1); and
</P>
<P>(ii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:
</P>
<P>(A) The identity of the reference food and the percent (or fraction) that the calories differ between the two foods are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., Larry's Reduced Calorie Lasagna, “25 percent fewer calories per oz (or 3 oz) than our regular Lasagna”); and
</P>
<P>(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per specified weight with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., “Calorie content has been reduced from 108 calories per 3 oz to 83 calories per 3 oz.”) is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.
</P>
<P>(iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section may not be made on the label or labeling of food if the reference food meets the definition for “low calorie.”
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Sugar content claims</I>—(1) <I>Use of terms such as “sugar free,” “free of sugar,” “no sugar,” “zero sugar,” “without sugar,” “sugarless,” “trivial source of sugar,” “negligible source of sugar,” or “dietarily insignificant source of sugar.”</I> Consumers may reasonably be expected to regard terms that represent that the food contains no sugars or sweeteners e.g., “sugar free,” or “no sugar,” as indicating a product which is low in calories or significantly reduced in calories. Consequently, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a food may not be labeled with such terms unless:
</P>
<P>(i) The food contains less than 0.5 g of sugars, as defined in § 101.9(c)(6)(ii), per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving or, in the case of a meal product or main dish product, less than 0.5 g of sugars per labeled serving; and
</P>
<P>(ii) The food contains no ingredient that is a sugar or that is generally understood by consumers to contain sugars unless the listing of the ingredient in the ingredient statement is followed by an asterisk that refers to the statement below the list of ingredients, which states “adds a trivial amount of sugar,” “adds a negligible amount of sugar,” or “adds a dietarily insignificant amount of sugar;” and
</P>
<P>(iii)(A) It is labeled “low calorie” or “reduced calorie” or bears a relative claim of special dietary usefulness labeled in compliance with paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(5) of this section, or, if a dietary supplement, it meets the definition in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for “low calorie” but is prohibited by §§ 101.13(b)(5) and 101.60(a)(4) from bearing the claim; or
</P>
<P>(B) Such term is immediately accompanied, each time it is used, by either the statement “not a reduced calorie food,” “not a low calorie food,” or “not for weight control.”
</P>
<P>(2) The terms “no added sugar,” “without added sugar,” or “no sugar added” may be used only if:
</P>
<P>(i) No amount of sugars, as defined in § 101.9(c)(6)(ii), or any other ingredient that contains sugars that functionally substitute for added sugars is added during processing or packaging; and
</P>
<P>(ii) The product does not contain an ingredient containing added sugars such as jam, jelly, or concentrated fruit juice; and
</P>
<P>(iii) The sugars content has not been increased above the amount present in the ingredients by some means such as the use of enzymes, except where the intended functional effect of the process is not to increase the sugars content of a food, and a functionally insignificant increase in sugars results; and
</P>
<P>(iv) The food that it resembles and for which it substitutes normally contains added sugars; and
</P>
<P>(v) The product bears a statement that the food is not “low calorie” or “calorie reduced” (unless the food meets the requirements for a “low” or “reduced calorie” food) and that directs consumers' attention to the nutrition panel for further information on sugar and calorie content.
</P>
<P>(3) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply to a factual statement that a food, including foods intended specifically for infants and children less than 2 years of age, is unsweetened or contains no added sweeteners in the case of a food that contains apparent substantial inherent sugar content, e.g., juices.
</P>
<P>(4) The claims provided for in paragraph (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section may be used on labels or in labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals that are intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age.
</P>
<P>(5) The terms “reduced sugar,” “reduced in sugar,” “sugar reduced,” “less sugar,” “lower sugar” or “lower in sugar” may be used on the label or in labeling of foods, except meal products as defined in § 101.13(l), main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), and dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals, provided that:
</P>
<P>(i) The food contains at least 25 percent less sugar per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference food as described in § 101.13(j)(1); and
</P>
<P>(ii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:
</P>
<P>(A) The identity of the reference food and the percent (or fraction) that the sugar differs between the two foods are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “these corn flakes contain 25 percent less sugar than our sugar coated corn flakes”); and
</P>
<P>(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the sugar in the product per labeled serving with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., “Sugar content has been lowered from 8 g to 6 g per serving.”) is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.
</P>
<P>(6) The terms defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section may be used on the label or in the labeling of a meal product as defined in § 101.13(l) and a main dish product as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:
</P>
<P>(i) The food contains at least 25 percent less sugars per 100 g of food than an appropriate reference food as described in § 101.13(j)(1), and
</P>
<P>(ii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:
</P>
<P>(A) The identity of the reference food and the percent (or fraction) that the sugars differ between the two foods are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., reduced sweet and sour shrimp dinner, “25 percent less sugar per 3 oz than our regular sweet and sour shrimp dinner”); and
</P>
<P>(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per specified weight with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., “Sugar content has been reduced from 17 g per 3 oz to 13 g per 3 oz.”) is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.

<DIV8 N="101.65" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="2">
<HEAD>§ 101.65   Implied nutrient content claims and related label statements.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General requirements.</I> An implied nutrient content claim can only be made on the label and in labeling of the food if:
</P>
<P>(1) The claim uses one of the terms described in this section in accordance with the definition for that term;
</P>
<P>(2) The claim is made in accordance with the general requirements for nutrient content claims in § 101.13; and
</P>
<P>(3) The food for which the claim is made is labeled in accordance with § 101.9, § 101.10, or § 101.36, as applicable.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Label statements that are not implied claims.</I> Certain label statements about the nature of a product are not nutrient content claims unless such statements are made in a context that would make them an implied claim under § 101.13(b)(2). The following types of label statements are generally not implied nutrient content claims and, as such, are not subject to the requirements of § 101.13 and this section:
</P>
<P>(1) A claim that a specific ingredient or food component is absent from a product, provided that the purpose of such claim is to facilitate avoidance of the substances because of food allergies (see § 105.62 of this chapter), food intolerance, religious beliefs, or dietary practices such as vegetarianism or other nonnutrition related reason, e.g., “100 percent milk free;”
</P>
<P>(2) A claim about a substance that is nonnutritive or that does not have a nutritive function, e.g., “contains no preservatives,” “no artificial colors;”
</P>
<P>(3) A claim about the presence of an ingredient that is perceived to add value to the product, e.g., “made with real butter,” “made with whole fruit,” or “contains honey,” except that claims about the presence of ingredients other than vitamins or minerals or that are represented as a source of vitamins and minerals are not allowed on labels or in labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals that are not in conventional food form.
</P>
<P>(4) A statement of identity for a food in which an ingredient constitutes essentially 100 percent of a food (e.g., “corn oil,” “oat bran,” “dietary supplement of vitamin C 60 mg tablet”).
</P>
<P>(5) A statement of identity that names as a characterizing ingredient, an ingredient associated with a nutrient benefit (e.g., “corn oil margarine,” “oat bran muffins,” or “whole wheat bagels”), unless such claim is made in a context in which label or labeling statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication suggest that a nutrient is absent or present in a certain amount; and
</P>
<P>(6) A label statement made in compliance with a specific provision of part 105 of this chapter, solely to note that a food has special dietary usefulness relative to a physical, physiological, pathological, or other condition, where the claim identifies the special diet of which the food is intended to be a part.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Particular implied nutrient content claims.</I> (1) Claims about the food or an ingredient therein that suggest that a nutrient or an ingredient is absent or present in a certain amount (e.g., “high in oat bran”) are implied nutrient content claims and must comply with paragraph (a) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) The phrases “contains the same amount of [nutrient] as a [food]” and “as much [nutrient] as a [food]” may be used on the label or in the labeling of foods, provided that the amount of the nutrient in the reference food is enough to qualify that food as a “good source” of that nutrient, and the labeled food, on a per serving basis, is an equivalent, good source of that nutrient (e.g., “as much fiber as an apple,” “Contains the same amount of Vitamin C as an 8 oz glass of orange juice.”).
</P>
<P>(3) Claims may be made that a food contains or is made with an ingredient that is known to contain a particular nutrient, or is prepared in a way that affects the content of a particular nutrient in the food, if the finished food is either “low” in or a “good source” of the nutrient that is associated with the ingredient or type of preparation. If a more specific level is claimed (e.g., “high in ______), that level of the nutrient must be present in the food. For example, a claim that a food contains oat bran is a claim that it is a good source of dietary fiber; that a food is made only with vegetable oil is a claim that it is low in saturated fat; and that a food contains no oil is a claim that it is fat free.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>General nutritional claims.</I> (1) This paragraph covers labeling claims that are implied nutrient content claims because they:
</P>
<P>(i) Suggest that a food because of its nutrient content may help consumers maintain healthy dietary practices; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Are made in connection with an explicit or implicit claim or statement about a nutrient (e.g., “healthy, contains 3 grams of fat”).
</P>
<P>(2) You may use the term “healthy” or related terms (e.g., “health,” “healthful,” “healthfully,” “healthfulness,” “healthier,” “healthiest,” “healthily,” and “healthiness”) as an implied nutrient content claim on the label or in labeling of a food that is useful in creating a diet that is consistent with dietary recommendations if:

</P>
<P>(i) The food meets the following conditions for fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and other nutrients:

<HEAD>§ 101.67   Use of nutrient content claims for butter.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Claims may be made to characterize the level of nutrients, including fat, in butter if:
</P>
<P>(1) The claim complies with the requirements of § 101.13 and with the requirements of the regulations in this subpart that define the particular nutrient content claim that is used and how it is to be presented. In determining whether a claim is appropriate, the calculation of the percent fat reduction in milkfat shall be based on the 80 percent milkfat requirement provided by the statutory standard for butter (21 U.S.C. 321a);
</P>
<P>(2) The product contains cream or milk, including milk constituents (including, but not limited to, whey, casein, modified whey, and salts of casein), or both, with or without added salt, with or without safe and suitable colorings, with or without nutrients added to comply with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and with or without safe and suitable bacterial cultures. The product may contain safe and suitable ingredients to improve texture, prevent syneresis, add flavor, extend shelf life, improve appearance, and add sweetness. The product may contain water to replace milkfat although the amount of water in the product shall be less than the amount of cream, milk, or milk constituents;
</P>
<P>(3) The product is not nutritionally inferior, as defined in § 101.3(e)(4), to butter as produced under 21 U.S.C. 321a; and
</P>
<P>(4) If the product would violate 21 U.S.C. 321a but for the nutrient content claim that characterizes the level of nutrients, that claim shall be an explicit claim that is included as part of the common or usual name of the product.
</P>
<P>(b) Deviations from the ingredient provisions of 21 U.S.C. 321a must be the minimum necessary to achieve similar performance characteristics as butter as produced under 21 U.S.C. 321a, or the food will be deemed to be adulterated under section 402(b) of the act. The performance characteristics (e.g., physical properties, organoleptic characteristics, functional properties, shelf life) of the product shall be similar to butter as produced under 21 U.S.C. 321a. If there is a significant difference in performance characteristics (that materially limits the uses of the product compared to butter,) the label shall include a statement informing the consumer of such difference (e.g., if appropriate, “not recommended for baking purposes”). Such statement shall comply with the requirements of § 101.13(d). The modified product shall perform at least one of the principal functions of butter substantially as well as butter as produced under 21 U.S.C. 321a.
</P>
<P>(c)(1) Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of this part.
</P>
<P>(2) Safe and suitable ingredients added to improve texture, prevent syneresis, add flavor, extend shelf life, improve appearance, or add sweetness and water added to replace milkfat shall be identified with an asterisk in the ingredient statement. The statement “*Ingredients not in regular butter” shall immediately follow the ingredient statement in the same type size.

The statement shall specify the level at which the nutrient must be present or what other conditions concerning the food must be met for the use of the term in labels or labeling to be appropriate, as well as any factors that would make the use of the term inappropriate.
</P>
<P>B. A detailed explanation, supported by any necessary data, of why use of the food component characterized by the claim is of importance in human nutrition by virtue of its presence or absence at the levels that such claim would describe. This explanation shall also state what nutritional benefit to the public will derive from use of the claim as proposed, and why such benefit is not available through the use of existing terms defined by regulation under section 403(r)(2)(A)(i) of the act. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the analysis should specifically address nutritional needs of such group, and should include scientific data sufficient for such purpose.
</P>
<P>C. Analytical data that shows the amount of the nutrient that is the subject of the claim and that is present in the types of foods for which the claim is intended. The assays should be performed on representative samples using the AOAC INTERNATIONAL (AOAC International) methods where available. If no AOAC International method is available, the petitioner shall submit the assay method used, and data establishing the validity of the method for assaying the nutrient in the particular food. The validation data should include a statistical analysis of the analytical and product variability.
</P>
<P>D. A detailed analysis of the potential effect of the use of the proposed claim on food consumption and of any corresponding changes in nutrient intake. The latter item shall specifically address the intake of nutrients that have beneficial and negative consequences in the total diet. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the above analysis shall specifically address the dietary practices of such group and shall include data sufficient to demonstrate that the dietary analysis is representative of such group.
</P>
<P>E. The petitioner is required to submit either a claim for categorical exclusion under § 25.30 or § 25.32 of this chapter or an environmental assessment under § 25.40 of this chapter.

<P>The undersigned, __________________ submits this petition pursuant to section 403(r)(4) or 403(r)(5)(D) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to (statement of the substance and its health claim).
</P>
<P>Attached hereto, and constituting a part of this petition, are the following:
</P>
<P>A. Preliminary requirements. A complete explanation of how the substance conforms to the requirements of § 101.14(b) (21 CFR 101.14(b)). For petitions where the subject substance is a food ingredient or a component of a food ingredient, the petitioner should compile a comprehensive list of the specific ingredients that will be added to the food to supply the substance in the food bearing the health claim. For each such ingredient listed, the petitioner should state how the ingredient complies with the requirements of § 101.14(b)(3)(ii), e.g., that its use is generally recognized as safe (GRAS), listed as a food additive, or authorized by a prior sanction issued by the agency, and what the basis is for the GRAS claim, the food additive status, or prior sanctioned status.
</P>
<P>B. Summary of scientific data. The summary of scientific data provides the basis upon which authorizing a health claim can be justified as providing the health benefit. The summary must establish that, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles), there is significant scientific agreement among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by such evidence.
</P>
<P>The summary shall state what public health benefit will derive from use of the claim as proposed. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the summary shall specifically address nutritional needs of such group and shall include scientific data showing how the claim is likely to assist in meeting such needs.
</P>
<P>The summary shall concentrate on the findings of appropriate review articles, National Institutes of Health consensus development conferences, and other appropriate resource materials. Issues addressed in the summary shall include answers to such questions as:
</P>
<P>1. Is there an optimum level of the particular substance to be consumed beyond which no benefit would be expected?
</P>
<P>2. Is there any level at which an adverse effect from the substance or from foods containing the substance occurs for any segment of the population?
</P>
<P>3. Are there certain populations that must receive special consideration?
</P>
<P>4. What other nutritional or health factors (both positive and negative) are important to consider when consuming the substance?
</P>
<P>In addition, the summary of scientific data shall include a detailed analysis of the potential effect of the use of the proposed claim on food consumption, specifically any change due to significant alterations in eating habits and corresponding changes in nutrient intake resulting from such changes in food consumption. The latter item shall specifically address the effect on the intake of nutrients that have beneficial and negative consequences in the total diet.
</P>
<P>If the claim is intended for a significant subpopulation within the general U.S. population, the analysis shall specifically address the dietary practices of such group, and shall include data sufficient to demonstrate that the dietary analysis is representative of such group (e.g., adolescents or the elderly).
</P>
<P>If appropriate, the petition shall explain the prevalence of the disease or health-related condition in the U.S. population and the relevance of the claim in the context of the total daily diet.
</P>
<P>Also, the summary shall demonstrate that the substance that is the subject of the proposed claim conforms to the definition of the term “substance” in § 101.14(a)(2).
</P>
<P>C. Analytical data that show the amount of the substance that is present in representative foods that would be candidates to bear the claim should be obtained from representative samples using methods from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL (AOAC), where available. If no AOAC method is available, the petitioner shall submit the assay method used and data establishing the validity of the method for assaying the substance in food. The validation data should include a statistical analysis of the analytical and product variability.
</P>
<P>D. Model health claim. One or more model health claims that represent label statements that may be used on a food label or in labeling for a food to characterize the relationship between the substance in a food to a disease or health-related condition that is justified by the summary of scientific data provided in section C of the petition. The model health claim shall include:
</P>
<P>1. A brief capsulized statement of the relevant conclusions of the summary, and
</P>
<P>2. A statement of how this substance helps the consumer to attain a total dietary pattern or goal associated with the health benefit that is provided.
</P>
<P>E. The petition shall include the following attachments:
</P>
<P>1. Copies of any computer literature searches done by the petitioner (e.g., Medline).
</P>
<P>2. Copies of articles cited in the literature searches and other information as follows:
</P>
<P>a. All information relied upon for the support of the health claim, including copies of publications or other information cited in review articles and used to perform meta-analyses.
</P>
<P>b. All information concerning adverse consequences to any segment of the population (e.g., sensitivity to the substance).
</P>
<P>c. All information pertaining to the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>F. The petitioner is required to submit either a claim for categorical exclusion under § 25.30 or § 25.32 of this chapter or an environmental assessment under § 25.40 of this chapter.

<HEAD>§ 101.72   Health claims: calcium, vitamin D, and osteoporosis.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Relationship between calcium, vitamin D, and osteoporosis.</I> An inadequate intake of calcium or calcium and vitamin D contributes to low peak bone mass, which has been identified as one of many risk factors in the development of osteoporosis. Peak bone mass is the total quantity of bone present at maturity, and experts believe that it has the greatest bearing on whether a person will be at risk of developing osteoporosis and related bone fractures later in life. Another factor that influences total bone mass and susceptibility to osteoporosis is the rate of bone loss after skeletal maturity. Vitamin D is required for normal absorption of calcium and to prevent the occurrence of high serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration, which stimulates mobilization of calcium from the skeleton and can lower bone mass. Calcium, along with vitamin D and several other nutrients, is required for normal bone mineralization. While vitamin D is required for optimal bone mineralization, it is more effective when calcium intake is adequate. An adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is thought to exert a positive effect during adolescence and early adulthood in optimizing the amount of bone that is laid down. However, the upper limit of peak bone mass is genetically determined. The mechanism through which adequate intakes of calcium and vitamin D and optimal peak bone mass reduce the risk of osteoporosis is thought to be as follows. All persons lose bone with age. Hence, those with higher bone mass at maturity take longer to reach the critically reduced mass at which bones can fracture easily. The rate of bone loss after skeletal maturity also influences the amount of bone present at old age and can influence an individual's risk of developing osteoporosis. Maintenance of adequate intakes of calcium and vitamin D later in life is thought to be important in reducing the rate of bone loss particularly in the elderly and in women during the first decade following menopause, but a significant protective effect is also seen among men and younger women.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Significance of calcium or calcium and vitamin D.</I> Adequate calcium intake, or adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, is not the only recognized risk factor in the development of osteoporosis, which is a multifactorial bone disease. Maintenance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intakes throughout life is necessary to achieve optimal peak bone mass and to reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life. However, vitamin D is most effective in this regard when calcium intake is adequate. Increasing intake of calcium has been shown to have beneficial effects on bone health independent of dietary vitamin D.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Requirements.</I> (1) All requirements set forth in § 101.14 shall be met.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Specific requirements</I>—(i) <I>Nature of the claim.</I> A health claim associating calcium or, when appropriate, calcium and vitamin D with a reduced risk of osteoporosis may be made on the label or labeling of a food described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (d)(1) of this section, provided that:
</P>
<P>(A) The claim makes clear the importance of adequate calcium intake, or when appropriate, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, throughout life, in a healthful diet, are essential to reduce osteoporosis risk. The claim does not imply that adequate calcium intake, or when appropriate, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, is the only recognized risk factor for the development of osteoporosis;
</P>
<P>(B) The claim does not attribute any degree of reduction in risk of osteoporosis to maintaining an adequate dietary calcium intake, or when appropriate, an adequate dietary calcium and vitamin D intake, throughout life.

<HEAD>§ 101.73   Health claims: dietary lipids and cancer.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Relationship between fat and cancer.</I> (1) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, and dietary factors.
</P>
<P>(2) Among dietary factors, the strongest positive association has been found between total fat intake and risk of some types of cancer. Based on the totality of the publicly available scientific evidence, there is significant scientific agreement among experts, qualified by training and experience to evaluate such evidence, that diets high in total fat are associated with an increased cancer risk. Research to date, although not conclusive, demonstrates that the total amount of fats, rather than any specific type of fat, is positively associated with cancer risk. The mechanism by which total fat affects cancer has not yet been established.
</P>
<P>(3) A question that has been the subject of considerable research is whether the effect of fat on cancer is site-specific. Neither human nor animal studies are consistent in the association of fat intake with specific cancer sites.
</P>
<P>(4) Another question that has been raised is whether the association of total fat intake to cancer risk is independently associated with energy intakes, or whether the association of fat with cancer risk is the result of the higher energy (caloric) intake normally associated with high fat intake. FDA has concluded that evidence from both animal and human studies indicates that total fat intake alone, independent of energy intake, is associated with cancer risk.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Significance of the relationship between fat intake and risk of cancer.</I> (1) Cancer is ranked as a leading cause of death in the United States. The overall economic costs of cancer, including direct health care costs and losses due to morbidity and mortality, are very high.
</P>
<P>(2) U.S. diets tend to be high in fat and high in calories. The average U.S. diet is estimated to contain 36 to 37 percent of calories from total fat. Current dietary guidelines from the Federal Government and other national health professional organizations recommend that dietary fat intake be reduced to a level of 30 percent or less of energy (calories) from total fat. In order to reduce intake of total fat, individuals should choose diets which are high in vegetables, fruits, and grain products (particularly whole grain products), choose lean cuts of meats, fish, and poultry, substitute low-fat dairy products for higher fat products, and use fats and oils sparingly.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Requirements.</I> (1) All requirements set forth in § 101.14 shall be met.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Specific requirements</I>—(i) <I>Nature of the claim.</I> A health claim associating diets low in fat with reduced risk of cancer may be made on the label or labeling of a food described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, provided that:
</P>
<P>(A) The claim states that diets low in fat “may” or “might” reduce the risk of some cancers;
</P>
<P>(B) In specifying the disease, the claim uses the following terms: “some types of cancer” or “some cancers”;
</P>
<P>(C) In specifying the nutrient, the claim uses the term “total fat” or “fat”;
</P>
<P>(D) The claim does not specify types of fat or fatty acid that may be related to the risk of cancer;
</P>
<P>(E) The claim does not attribute any degree of cancer risk reduction to diets low in fat; and
</P>
<P>(F) The claim indicates that the development of cancer depends on many factors.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Nature of the food.</I> The food shall meet all of the nutrient content requirements of § 101.62 for a “low fat” food; except that fish and game meats (i.e., deer, bison, rabbit, quail, wild turkey, geese, ostrich) may meet the requirements for “extra lean” in § 101.62.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Optional information.</I> (1) The claim may identify one or more of the following risk factors for development of cancer: Family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, and dietary factors.
</P>
<P>(2) The claim may include information from paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section which summarize the relationship between dietary fat and cancer and the significance of the relationship.
</P>
<P>(3) The claim may indicate that it is consistent with “Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans,” U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Government Printing Office.
</P>
<P>(4) The claim may include information on the number of people in the United States who have cancer. The sources of this information must be identified, and it must be current information from the National Center for Health Statistics, the National Institutes of Health, or “Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans,” USDA and DHHS, Government Printing Office.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Model health claims.</I> The following model health claims may be used in food labeling to describe the relationship between dietary fat and cancer:
</P>
<P>(1) Development of cancer depends on many factors. A diet low in total fat may reduce the risk of some cancers.
</P>
<P>(2) Eating a healthful diet low in fat may help reduce the risk of some types of cancers. Development of cancer is associated with many factors, including a family history of the disease, cigarette smoking, and what you eat.

<HEAD>§ 101.74   Health claims: sodium and hypertension.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Relationship between sodium and hypertension (high blood pressure).</I> (1) Hypertension, or high blood pressure, generally means a systolic blood pressure of greater than 140 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or a diastolic blood pressure of greater than 90 mm Hg. Normotension, or normal blood pressure, is a systolic blood pressure below 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. Sodium is specified here as the chemical entity or electrolyte “sodium” and is distinguished from sodium chloride, or salt, which is 39 percent sodium by weight.
</P>
<P>(2) The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in sodium are associated with a high prevalence of hypertension or high blood pressure and with increases in blood pressure with age, and that diets low in sodium are associated with a low prevalence of hypertension or high blood pressure and with a low or no increase of blood pressure with age.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Significance of sodium in relation to high blood pressure.</I> (1) High blood pressure is a public health concern primarily because it is a major risk factor for mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke. Early management of high blood pressure is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing mortality associated with coronary heart disease and stroke. There is a continuum of mortality risk that increases as blood pressures rise. Individuals with high blood pressure are at greatest risk, and individuals with moderately high, high normal, and normal blood pressure are at steadily decreasing risk. The scientific evidence indicates that reducing sodium intake lowers blood pressure and associated risks in many but not all hypertensive individuals. There is also evidence that reducing sodium intake lowers blood pressure and associated risks in many but not all normotensive individuals as well.
</P>
<P>(2) The populations at greatest risk for high blood pressure, and those most likely to benefit from sodium reduction, include those with family histories of high blood pressure, the elderly, males because they develop hypertension earlier in life than females, and black males and females. Although some population groups are at greater risk than others, high blood-pressure is a disease of public health concern for all population groups. Sodium intake, alcohol consumption, and obesity are identified risk factors for high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>(3) Sodium intakes exceed recommended levels in almost every group in the United States. One of the major public health recommendations relative to high blood pressure is to decrease consumption of salt. On a population-wide basis, reducing the average sodium intake would have a small but significant effect on reducing the average blood pressure, and, consequently, reducing mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke.
</P>
<P>(4) Sodium is an essential nutrient, and experts have recommended a safe minimum level of 500 milligrams (mg) sodium per day and an upper level of 2,400 mg sodium per day, the FDA Daily Value for sodium.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Requirements.</I> (1) All requirements set forth in § 101.14 shall be met.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Specific requirements</I>—(i) <I>Nature of the claim.</I> A health claim associating diets low in sodium with reduced risk of high blood pressure may be made on the label or labeling of a food described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, provided that:
</P>
<P>(A) The claim states that diets low in sodium “may” or “might” reduce the risk of high blood pressure;
</P>
<P>(B) In specifying the disease, the claim uses the term “high blood pressure”;
</P>
<P>(C) In specifying the nutrient, the claim uses the term “sodium”;
</P>
<P>(D) The claim does not attribute any degree of reduction in risk of high blood pressure to diets low in sodium; and
</P>
<P>(E) The claim indicates that development of high blood pressure depends on many factors.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Nature of the food.</I> The food shall meet all of the nutrient content requirements of § 101.61 for a “low sodium” food.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Optional information.</I> (1) The claim may identify one or more of the following risk factors for development of high blood pressure in addition to dietary sodium consumption: Family history of high blood pressure, growing older, alcohol consumption, and excess weight.
</P>
<P>(2) The claim may include information from paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, which summarizes the relationship between dietary sodium and high blood pressure and the significance of the relationship.
</P>
<P>(3) The claim may include information on the number of people in the United States who have high blood pressure. The sources of this information must be identified, and it must be current information from the National Center for Health Statistics, the National Institutes of Health, or “Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans,” U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Government Printing Office.
</P>
<P>(4) The claim may indicate that it is consistent with “Nutrition and Your Health: U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans, DHHS and USDA, Government Printing Office.
</P>
<P>(5) In specifying the nutrient, the claim may include the term “salt” in addition to the term “sodium.”
</P>
<P>(6) In specifying the disease, the claim may include the term “hypertension” in addition to the term “high blood pressure.”
</P>
<P>(7) The claim may state that individuals with high blood pressure should consult their physicians for medical advice and treatment. If the claim defines high or normal blood pressure, then the health claim must state that individuals with high blood pressure should consult their physicians for medical advice and treatment.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Model health claims.</I> The following are model health claims that may be used in food labeling to describe the relationship between dietary sodium and high blood pressure:
</P>
<P>(1) Diets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure, a disease associated with many factors.

<HEAD>§ 101.75   Health claims: dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Relationship between dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease.</I> (1) Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system. Coronary heart disease is the most common and serious form of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood vessels. High blood total- and low density lipoprotein (LDL)- cholesterol levels are major modifiable risk factors in the development of coronary heart disease. High coronary heart disease rates occur among people with high blood cholesterol levels of 240 milligrams/decaliter (mg/dL) (6.21 millimoles per liter (mmol/L)) or above and LDL-cholesterol levels of 160 mg/dL (4.13 mmol/L) or above. Borderline high risk blood cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL (5.17 to 6.18 mmol/L) and 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/L) of LDL-cholesterol. Dietary lipids (fats) include fatty acids and cholesterol. Total fat, commonly referred to as fat, is composed of saturated fat (fatty acids containing no double bonds), and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat (fatty acids containing one or more double bonds).
</P>
<P>(2) The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with increased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus, with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with decreased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol, and thus, with decreased risk of developing coronary heart disease.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Significance of the relationship between dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease.</I> (1) Coronary heart disease is a major public health concern in the United States, primarily because it accounts for more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. Early management of risk factors for coronary heart disease is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of coronary heart disease. There is a continuum of mortality risk from coronary heart disease that increases with increasing levels of blood LDL-cholesterol. Individuals with high blood LDL-cholesterol are at greatest risk. A larger number of individuals with more moderately elevated cholesterol also have increased risk of coronary events; such individuals comprise a substantial proportion of the adult U.S. population. The scientific evidence indicates that reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intakes lowers blood LDL-cholesterol and risk of heart disease in most individuals. There is also evidence that reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intakes in persons with blood cholesterol levels in the normal range also reduces risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>(2) Other risk factors for coronary heart disease include a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, cigarette smoking, obesity (body weight 30 percent greater than ideal body weight), and lack of regular physical exercise.
</P>
<P>(3) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in many people in the United States. Intakes of cholesterol are, on average, at or above recommended levels. One of the major public health recommendations relative to coronary heart disease risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, and an average of 30 percent or less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 mg or less per day.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Requirements.</I> (1) All requirements set forth in § 101.14 shall be met, except § 101.14(e)(6) with respect to a raw fruit or vegetable.

</P>
<P>(d) <I>Optional information.</I> (1) The claim may identify one or more of the following risk factors in addition to saturated fat and cholesterol about which there is general scientific agreement that they are major risk factors for this disease: A family history of coronary heart disease, elevated blood total and LDL-cholesterol, excess body weight, high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diabetes, and physical inactivity.
</P>
<P>(2) The claim may indicate that the relationship of saturated fat and cholesterol to heart disease is through the intermediate link of “blood cholesterol” or “blood total- and LDL cholesterol.”
</P>
<P>(3) The claim may include information from paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, which summarize the relationship between dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease, and the significance of the relationship.

</P>
<P>(6) The claim may indicate that it is consistent with “Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans,” DHHS and USDA, Government Printing Office.
</P>
<P>(7) The claim may state that individuals with elevated blood total- or LDL-cholesterol should consult their physicians for medical advice and treatment. If the claim defines high or normal blood total- or LDL-cholesterol levels, then the claim shall state that individuals with high blood cholesterol should consult their physicians for medical advice and treatment.

Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with decreased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol, and thus, with decreased risk of developing coronary heart disease.
</P>
<P>(3) Populations with relatively low blood cholesterol levels tend to have dietary patterns that are not only low in total fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol, but are also relatively high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products. Although the specific roles of these plant foods are not yet fully understood, many studies have shown that diets high in plant foods are associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease. These studies correlate diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and grain products and nutrients from these diets, such as some types of fiber, with reduced coronary heart disease risk. Persons consuming these diets frequently have high intakes of dietary fiber, particularly soluble fibers. Currently, there is not scientific agreement as to whether a particular type of soluble fiber is beneficial, or whether the observed protective effects of fruits, vegetables, and grain products against heart disease are due to other components, or a combination of components, in these diets, including, but not necessarily limited to, some types of soluble fiber, other fiber components, other characteristics of the complex carbohydrate content of these foods, other nutrients in these foods, or displacement of saturated fat and cholesterol from the diet.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Significance of the relationship between diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol, and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary heart disease.</I> (1) Coronary heart disease is a major public health concern in the United States, primarily because it accounts for more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. Early management of risk factors for coronary heart disease is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of coronary heart disease. There is a continuum of mortality risk from coronary heart disease that increases with increasing levels of blood LDL-cholesterol. Individuals with high blood LDL-cholesterol are at greatest risk. A larger number of individuals with more moderately elevated cholesterol also have increased risk of coronary events; such individuals comprise a substantial proportion of the adult U.S. population. The scientific evidence indicates that reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intakes lowers blood LDL-cholesterol and risk of heart disease in most individuals, including persons with blood cholesterol levels in the normal range. Additionally, consuming diets high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products, foods that contain soluble fiber, may be a useful adjunct to a low saturated fat and low cholesterol diet.
</P>
<P>(2) Other risk factors for coronary heart disease include a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, cigarette smoking, obesity (body weight 30 percent greater than ideal body weight), and lack of regular physical exercise.
</P>
<P>(3) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in many people in the United States. Intakes of cholesterol are, on average, at or above recommended levels. Intakes of fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products are about half of recommended intake levels. One of the major public health recommendations relative to coronary heart disease risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, and an average of 30 percent or less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 mg or less per day. Recommended total dietary fiber intakes are about 25 grams (g) daily, of which about 25 percent (about 6 g) should be soluble fiber.
</P>
<P>(4) Current dietary guidance recommendations encourage decreased consumption of dietary fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol, and increased consumption of fiber-rich foods to help lower blood LDL-cholesterol levels. Results of numerous studies have shown that fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products can help lower blood LDL-cholesterol.

<HEAD>§ 101.78   Health claims: fruits and vegetables and cancer.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Relationship between substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and cancer risk.</I> (1) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, and dietary factors.
</P>
<P>(2) Although the specific roles of the numerous potentially protective substances in plant foods are not yet understood, many studies have shown that diets high in plant foods are associated with reduced risk of some types of cancers. These studies correlate diets rich in fruits and vegetables and nutrients from these diets, such as vitamin C, vitamin A, and dietary fiber, with reduced cancer risk. Persons consuming these diets frequently have high intakes of these nutrients. Currently, there is not scientific agreement as to whether the observed protective effects of fruits and vegetables against cancer are due to a combination of the nutrient components of diets rich in fruits and vegetables, including but not necessarily limited to dietary fiber, vitamin A (as beta-carotene) and vitamin C, to displacement of fat from such diets, or to intakes of other substances in these foods which are not nutrients but may be protective against cancer risk.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Significance of the relationship between consumption of diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and risk of cancer.</I> (1) Cancer is ranked as a leading cause of death in the United States. The overall economic costs of cancer, including direct health care costs and losses due to morbidity and mortality, are very high.
</P>
<P>(2) U.S. diets tend to be high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables. Studies in various parts of the world indicate that populations who habitually consume a diet high in plant foods have lower risks of some cancers. These diets generally are low in fat and rich in many nutrients, including, but not limited to, dietary fiber, vitamin A (as beta-carotene), and vitamin C. Current dietary guidelines from Federal Government agencies and nationally recognized health professional organizations recommend decreased consumption of fats (less than 30 percent of calories), maintenance of desirable body weight, and increased consumption of fruits and vegetables (5 or more servings daily), particularly those fruits and vegetables which contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, and vitamin C.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Requirements.</I> (1) All requirements set forth in § 101.14 shall be met.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Specific requirements</I>—(i) <I>Nature of the claim.</I> A health claim associating substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables with reduced risk of cancer may be made on the label or labeling of a food described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, provided that:
</P>
<P>(A) The claim states that diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables “may” or “might” reduce the risk of some cancers;
</P>
<P>(B) In specifying the disease, the claim uses the following terms: “some types of cancer”, or “some cancers”;
</P>
<P>(C) The claim characterizes fruits and vegetables as foods that are low in fat and may contain vitamin A, vitamin C, and dietary fiber;
</P>
<P>(D) The claim characterizes the food bearing the claim as containing one or more of the following, for which the food is a good source under § 101.54: dietary fiber, vitamin A, or vitamin C;
</P>
<P>(E) The claim does not attribute any degree of cancer risk reduction to diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables;
</P>
<P>(F) In specifying the fat component of the labeled food, the claim uses the term “total fat” or “fat”;
</P>
<P>(G) The claim does not specify types of fats or fatty acids that may be related to risk of cancer;
</P>
<P>(H) In specifying the dietary fiber component of the labeled food, the claim uses the term “fiber”, “dietary fiber”, or “total dietary fiber”;
</P>
<P>(I) The claim does not specify types of dietary fiber that may be related to risk of cancer; and
</P>
<P>(J) The claim indicates that development of cancer depends on many factors.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Nature of the food.</I> (A) The food shall be or shall contain a fruit or vegetable.
</P>
<P>(B) The food shall meet the nutrient content requirements of § 101.62 for a “low fat” food.
</P>
<P>(C) The food shall meet, without fortification, the nutrient content requirements of § 101.54 for a “good source” of at least one of the following: vitamin A, vitamin C, or dietary fiber.

<P>(d) <I>Optional information.</I> (1) The claim may include information from paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, which summarize the relationship between diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and some types of cancer and the significance of the relationship.
</P>
<P>(2) The claim may identify one or more of the following risk factors for development of cancer: Family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, and dietary factors.
</P>
<P>(3) The claim may use the word “beta-carotene” in parentheses after the term vitamin A, provided that the vitamin A in the food bearing the claim is beta-carotene.
</P>
<P>(4) The claim may indicate that it is consistent with “Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans,” U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Government Printing Office.
</P>
<P>(5) The claim may include information on the number of people in the United States who have cancer. The sources of this information must be identified, and it must be current information from the National Center for Health Statistics, the National Institutes of Health, or “Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans,” USDA and DHHS, Government Printing Office.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Model health claims.</I> The following model health claims may be used in food labeling to characterize the relationship between substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and cancer:
</P>
<P>(1) Low fat diets rich in fruits and vegetables (foods that are low in fat and may contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, and vitamin C) may reduce the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated with many factors. Broccoli is high in vitamins A and C, and it is a good source of dietary fiber.
</P>
<P>(2) Development of cancer depends on many factors. Eating a diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables, foods that are low in fat and may contain vitamin A, vitamin C, and dietary fiber, may reduce your risk of some cancers. Oranges, a food low in fat, are a good source of fiber and vitamin C.

<HEAD>§ 101.79   Health claims: Folate and neural tube defects.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Relationship between folate and neural tube defects</I>—(1) <I>Definition.</I> Neural tube defects are serious birth defects of the brain or spinal cord that can result in infant mortality or serious disability. The birth defects anencephaly and spina bifida are the most common forms of neural tube defects and account for about 90 percent of these defects. These defects result from failure of closure of the covering of the brain or spinal cord during early embryonic development. Because the neural tube forms and closes during early pregnancy, the defect may occur before a woman realizes that she is pregnant.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Relationship.</I> The available data show that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural tube defects. The strongest evidence for this relationship comes from an intervention study by the Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom that showed that women at risk of recurrence of a neural tube defect pregnancy who consumed a supplement containing 4 milligrams (mg)(4,000 micrograms (mcg)) folic acid daily before conception and continuing into early pregnancy had a reduced risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. (Products containing this level of folic acid are drugs). In addition, based on its review of a Hungarian intervention trial that reported periconceptional use of a multivitamin and multimineral preparation containing 800 mcg (0.8 mg) of folic acid, and its review of the observational studies that reported periconceptional use of multivitamins containing 0 to 1,000 mcg of folic acid, the Food and Drug Administration concluded that most of these studies had results consistent with the conclusion that folate, at levels attainable in usual diets, may reduce the risk of neural tube defects.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Significance of folate</I>—(1) <I>Public health concern.</I> Neural tube defects occur in approximately 0.6 of 1,000 live births in the United States (i.e., approximately 6 of 10,000 live births; about 2,500 cases among 4 million live births annually). Neural tube defects are believed to be caused by many factors. The single greatest risk factor for a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy is a personal or family history of a pregnancy affected with a such a defect. However, about 90 percent of infants with a neural tube defect are born to women who do not have a family history of these defects. The available evidence shows that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural tube defects but not of other birth defects.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Populations at risk.</I> Prevalence rates for neural tube defects have been reported to vary with a wide range of factors including genetics, geography, socioeconomic status, maternal birth cohort, month of conception, race, nutrition, and maternal health, including maternal age and reproductive history. Women with a close relative (i.e., sibling, niece, nephew) with a neural tube defect, those with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and women with seizure disorders who are being treated with valproic acid or carbamazepine are at significantly increased risk compared with women without these characteristics. Rates for neural tube defects vary within the United States, with lower rates observed on the west coast than on the east coast.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Those who may benefit.</I> Based on a synthesis of information from several studies, including those which used multivitamins containing folic acid at a daily dose level of ≥400 mcg (≥0.4 mg), the Public Health Service has inferred that folate alone at levels of 400 mcg (0.4 mg) per day may reduce the risk of neural tube defects. The protective effect found in studies of lower dose folate measured by the reduction in neural tube defect incidence, ranges from none to substantial; a reasonable estimate of the expected reduction in the United States is 50 percent. It is expected that consumption of adequate folate will avert some, but not all, neural tube defects. The underlying causes of neural tube defects are not known. Thus, it is not known what proportion of neural tube defects will be averted by adequate folate consumption. From the available evidence, the Public Health Service estimates that there is the potential for averting 50 percent of cases that now occur (i.e., about 1,250 cases annually). However, until further research is done, no firm estimate of this proportion will be available.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Requirements.</I> The label or labeling of food may contain a folate/neural tube defect health claim provided that:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>General requirements.</I> The health claim for a food meets all of the general requirements of § 101.14 for health claims, except that a food may qualify to bear the health claim if it meets the definition of the term “good source.”
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Specific requirements</I>—(i) <I>Nature of the claim</I>—(A) <I>Relationship.</I> A health claim that women who are capable of becoming pregnant and who consume adequate amounts of folate daily during their childbearing years may reduce their risk of having a pregnancy affected by spina bifida or other neural tube defects may be made on the label or labeling of food provided that:
</P>
<P>(B) <I>Specifying the nutrient.</I> In specifying the nutrient, the claim shall use the terms “folate,” “folic acid,” “folacin,” “folate, a B vitamin,” “folic acid, a B vitamin,” or “folacin, a B vitamin.”
</P>
<P>(C) <I>Specifying the condition.</I> In specifying the health- related condition, the claim shall identify the birth defects as “neural tube defects,” “birth defects spina bifida or anencephaly,” “birth defects of the brain or spinal cord anencephaly or spina bifida,” “spina bifida and anencephaly, birth defects of the brain or spinal cord,” “birth defects of the brain or spinal cord;” or “brain or spinal cord birth defects.”
</P>
<P>(D) <I>Multifactorial nature.</I> The claim shall not imply that folate intake is the only recognized risk factor for neural tube defects.
</P>
<P>(E) <I>Reduction in risk.</I> The claim shall not attribute any specific degree of reduction in risk of neural tube defects from maintaining an adequate folate intake throughout the childbearing years. The claim shall state that some women may reduce their risk of a neural tube defect pregnancy by maintaining adequate intakes of folate during their childbearing years. Optional statements about population-based estimates of risk reduction may be made in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(vi) of this section.
</P>
<P>(F) <I>Safe upper limit of daily intake.</I> Claims on foods that contain more than 100 percent of the Daily Value (DV) (400 mcg) when labeled for use by adults and children 4 or more years of age, or 800 mcg when labeled for use by pregnant or lactating women) shall identify the safe upper limit of daily intake with respect to the DV. The safe upper limit of daily intake value of 1,000 mcg (1 mg) may be included in parentheses.
</P>
<P>(G) The claim shall state that folate needs to be consumed as part of a healthful diet. 
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Nature of the food</I>—(A) <I>Requirements.</I> The food shall meet or exceed the requirements for a “good source” of folate as defined in § 101.54;
</P>
<P>(B) <I>Dietary supplements.</I> Dietary supplements shall meet the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards for disintegration and dissolution, except that if there are no applicable USP standards, the folate in the dietary supplement shall be shown to be bioavailable under the conditions of use stated on the product label.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Limitation.</I> The claim shall not be made on foods that contain more than 100 percent of the RDI for vitamin A as retinol or preformed vitamin A or vitamin D per serving or per unit.
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>Nutrition labeling.</I> The nutrition label shall include information about the amount of folate in the food. This information shall be declared after the declaration for iron if only the levels of vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron are provided, or in accordance with § 101.9 (c)(8) and (c)(9) if other optional vitamins or minerals are declared.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Optional information</I>—(i) <I>Risk factors.</I> The claim may specifically identify risk factors for neural tube defects. Where such information is provided, it may consist of statements from § 101.79(b)(1) or (b)(2) (e.g., Women at increased risk include those with a personal history of a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy, those with a close relative (i.e., sibling, niece, nephew) with a neural tube defect; those with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; those with seizure disorders who are being treated with valproic acid or carbamazepine) or from other parts of this paragraph (c)(3)(i).
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Relationship between folate and neural tube defects.</I> The claim may include statements from paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section that summarize the relationship between folate and neural tube defects and the significance of the relationship except for information specifically prohibited from the claim.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Personal history of a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy.</I> The claim may state that women with a history of a neural tube defect pregnancy should consult their physicians or health care providers before becoming pregnant. If such a statement is provided, the claim shall also state that all women should consult a health care provider when planning a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>Daily value.</I> The claim may identify 100 percent of the DV (100% DV; 400 mcg) for folate as the target intake goal.
</P>
<P>(v) <I>Prevalence.</I> The claim may provide estimates, expressed on an annual basis, of the number of neural tube defect-affected births among live births in the United States. Current estimates are provided in § 101.79(b)(1), and are approximately 6 of 10,000 live births annually (i.e., about 2,500 cases among 4 million live births annually). Data provided in § 101.79(b)(1) shall be used, unless more current estimates from the U.S. Public Health Service are available, in which case the latter may be cited.
</P>
<P>(vi) <I>Reduction in risk.</I> An estimate of the reduction in the number of neural tube defect-affected births that might occur in the United States if all women consumed adequate folate throughout their childbearing years may be included in the claim. Information contained in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may be used. If such an estimate (i.e., 50 percent) is provided, the estimate shall be accompanied by additional information that states that the estimate is population-based and that it does not reflect risk reduction that may be experienced by individual women.
</P>
<P>(vii) <I>Diets adequate in folate.</I> The claim may identify diets adequate in folate by using phrases such as “Sources of folate include fruits, vegetables, whole grain products, fortified cereals, and dietary supplements.” or “Adequate amounts of folate can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, dark green leafy vegetables, legumes, whole grain products, fortified cereals, or dietary supplements.” or “Adequate amounts of folate can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, including citrus fruits and juices, vegetables, including dark green leafy vegetables, legumes, whole grain products, including breads, rice, and pasta, fortified cereals, or a dietary supplement.”
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Model health claims.</I> The following are examples of model health claims that may be used in food labeling to describe the relationship between folate and neural tube defects:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Examples 1 and 2.</I> Model health claims appropriate for foods containing 100 percent or less of the DV for folate per serving or per unit (general population). The examples contain only the required elements:
</P>
<P>(i) Healthful diets with adequate folate may reduce a woman's risk of having a child with a brain or spinal cord birth defect.
</P>
<P>(ii) Adequate folate in healthful diets may reduce a woman's risk of having a child with a brain or spinal cord birth defect.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Example 3.</I> Model health claim appropriate for foods containing 100 percent or less of the DV for folate per serving or per unit. The example contains all required elements plus optional information: Women who consume healthful diets with adequate folate throughout their childbearing years may reduce their risk of having a child with a birth defect of the brain or spinal cord. Sources of folate include fruits, vegetables, whole grain products, fortified cereals, and dietary supplements.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Example 4.</I> Model health claim appropriate for foods intended for use by the general population and containing more than 100 percent of the DV of folate per serving or per unit: Women who consume healthful diets with adequate folate may reduce their risk of having a child with birth defects of the brain or spinal cord.

<HEAD>§ 101.80   Health claims: dietary noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners and dental caries.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Relationship between dietary carbohydrates and dental caries.</I> (1) Dental caries, or tooth decay, is a disease caused by many factors. Both environmental and genetic factors can affect the development of dental caries. Risk factors include tooth enamel crystal structure and mineral content, plaque quantity and quality, saliva quantity and quality, individual immune response, types and physical characteristics of foods consumed, eating behaviors, presence of acid producing oral bacteria, and cultural influences.
</P>
<P>(2) The relationship between consumption of fermentable carbohydrates, i.e., dietary sugars and starches, and tooth decay is well established. Sucrose, also known as sugar, is one of the most, but not the only, cariogenic sugars in the diet. Bacteria found in the mouth are able to metabolize most dietary carbohydrates, producing acid and forming dental plaque. The more frequent and longer the exposure of teeth to dietary sugars and starches, the greater the risk for tooth decay.
</P>
<P>(3) Dental caries continues to affect a large proportion of Americans. Although there has been a decline in the prevalence of dental caries among children in the United States, the disease remains widespread throughout the population, imposing a substantial burden on Americans. Recent Federal government dietary guidelines recommend that Americans choose diets that are moderate in sugars and avoid excessive snacking. Frequent between-meal snacks that are high in sugars and starches may be more harmful to teeth than eating such foods at meals and then brushing.
</P>
<P>(4) Noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners, such as sugar alcohols, can be used to replace dietary sugars, such as sucrose and corn sweeteners, in foods such as chewing gums and certain confectioneries. Noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners are significantly less cariogenic than dietary sugars and other fermentable carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Significance of the relationship between noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners and dental caries.</I> Noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners do not promote dental caries. The noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are slowly metabolized by bacteria to form some acid. The rate and amount of acid production is significantly less than that from sucrose and other fermentable carbohydrates and does not cause the loss of important minerals from tooth enamel.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Requirements.</I> (1) All requirements set forth in § 101.14 shall be met, except that noncariogenic carbohydrate sweetener-containing foods listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are exempt from § 101.14(e)(6).
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Specific requirements</I>—(i) <I>Nature of the claim.</I> A health claim relating noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners, compared to other carbohydrates, and the nonpromotion of dental caries may be made on the label or labeling of a food described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, provided that:
</P>
<P>(A) The claim shall state that frequent between-meal consumption of foods high in sugars and starches can promote tooth decay.
</P>
<P>(B) The claim shall state that the noncariogenic carbohydrate sweetener present in the food “does not promote,” “may reduce the risk of,” “useful [or is useful] in not promoting,” or “expressly [or is expressly] for not promoting” dental caries.
</P>

<HEAD>§ 101.81   Health claims: Soluble fiber from certain foods and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Relationship between diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from certain foods and the risk of CHD.</I> (1) Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common and serious forms of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood vessels. High blood total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels are associated with increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. High CHD rates occur among people with high total cholesterol levels of 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (6.21 (mmol/L)) or above and LDL-cholesterol levels of 160 mg/dL (4.13 mmol/L) or above. Borderline high risk total cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL (5.17 to 6.18 mmol/L) and 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/L) of LDL-cholesterol. The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with increased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus, with increased risk of CHD.
</P>
<P>(2) Populations with a low incidence of CHD tend to have relatively low blood total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels. These populations also tend to have dietary patterns that are not only low in total fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol, but are also relatively high in fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products, such as whole oat products. 
</P>
<P>(3) Scientific evidence demonstrates that diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of CHD. Other evidence demonstrates that the addition of soluble fiber from certain foods to a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol may also help to reduce the risk of CHD.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Significance of the relationship between diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from certain foods and the risk of CHD.</I> (1) CHD is a major public health concern in the United States. It accounts for more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. Early management of risk factors for CHD is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of CHD. High blood total and LDL-cholesterol are major modifiable risk factors in the development of CHD.
</P>
<P>(2) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in the diets of many people in the United States. One of the major public health recommendations relative to CHD risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat and an average of 30 percent or less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 milligrams (mg) or less per day. Scientific evidence demonstrates that diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with lower blood total- and LDL-cholesterol levels. Soluble fiber from certain foods, when included in a low saturated fat and cholesterol diet, also helps to lower blood total- and LDL-cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Requirements.</I> (1) All requirements set forth in § 101.14 shall be met. The label and labeling of foods containing psyllium husk shall be consistent with the provisions of § 101.17(f).
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Specific requirements</I>—(i) <I>Nature of the claim.</I> A health claim associating diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from certain foods with reduced risk of heart disease may be made on the label or labeling of a food described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, provided that:
</P>
<P>(A) The claim states that diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from certain foods “may” or “might” reduce the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>(B) In specifying the disease, the claim uses the following terms: “heart disease” or “coronary heart disease”;
</P>
<P>(C) In specifying the substance, the claim uses the term “soluble fiber” qualified by the name of the eligible source of soluble fiber (provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)) of this section. Additionally, the claim may use the name of the food product that contains the eligible source of soluble fiber;
</P>
<P>(D) In specifying the fat component, the claim uses the terms “saturated fat” and “cholesterol”;
</P>
<P>(E) The claim does not attribute any degree of risk reduction for CHD to diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from the eligible food sources from paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section; and 
</P>
<P>(F) The claim does not imply that consumption of diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from the eligible food sources from paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section is the only recognized means of achieving a reduced risk of CHD.
</P>
<P>(G) The claim specifies the daily dietary intake of the soluble fiber source that is necessary to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and the contribution one serving of the product makes to the specified daily dietary intake level. Daily dietary intake levels of soluble fiber sources listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section that have been associated with reduced risk coronary heart disease are:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) 3 g or more per day of β-glucan soluble fiber from either whole oats or barley, or a combination of whole oats and barley.
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) 7 g or more per day of soluble fiber from psyllium seed husk.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Nature of the substance—Eligible sources of soluble fiber.</I> (A) Beta (β) glucan soluble fiber from the whole oat and barley sources listed below. β-glucan soluble fiber will be determined by method No. 992.28 from the “Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC INTERNATIONAL,” 16th ed. (1995), which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

<HEAD>§ 101.83   Health claims: plant sterol/stanol esters and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Relationship between diets that include plant sterol/stanol esters and the risk of CHD.</I> (1) Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common and serious forms of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood vessels. High blood total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are associated with increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. High CHD rates occur among people with high total cholesterol levels of 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (6.21 millimole per liter (mmol/l)) or above and LDL cholesterol levels of 160 mg/dL (4.13 mmol/l) or above. Borderline high risk blood cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL (5.17 to 6.18 mmol/l) for total cholesterol, and 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/l) of LDL cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>(2) Populations with a low incidence of CHD tend to have relatively low blood total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels. These populations also tend to have dietary patterns that are not only low in total fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol, but are also relatively high in plant foods that contain dietary fiber and other components. 
</P>
<P>(3) Scientific evidence demonstrates that diets that include plant sterol/stanol esters may reduce the risk of CHD.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Significance of the relationship between diets that include plant sterol/stanol esters and the risk of CHD.</I> (1) CHD is a major public health concern in the United States. It accounts for more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. Early management of risk factors for CHD is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of CHD. High blood total and LDL cholesterol are major modifiable risk factors in the development of CHD. 
</P>
<P>(2) The scientific evidence establishes that including plant sterol/stanol esters in the diet helps to lower blood total and LDL cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Requirements</I>—(1) <I>General.</I> All requirements set forth in § 101.14 shall be met, except § 101.14(a)(4) with respect to the disqualifying level for total fat per 50 grams (g) in dressings for salad and spreads and § 101.14(e)(6) with respect to dressings for salad. 
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Specific requirements</I>—(i) <I>Nature of the claim.</I> A health claim associating diets that include plant sterol/stanol esters with reduced risk of heart disease may be made on the label or labeling of a food described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, provided that: 
</P>
<P>(A) The claim states that plant sterol/stanol esters should be consumed as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol; 
</P>
<P>(B) The claim states that diets that include plant sterol/stanol esters “may” or “might” reduce the risk of heart disease; 
</P>
<P>(C) In specifying the disease, the claim uses the following terms: “heart disease” or “coronary heart disease”; 
</P>
<P>(D) In specifying the substance, the claim uses the term “plant sterol esters” or “plant stanol esters,” except that if the sole source of the plant sterols or stanols is vegetable oil, the claim may use the term “vegetable oil sterol esters” or “vegetable oil stanol esters”; 
</P>
<P>(E) The claim does not attribute any degree of risk reduction for CHD to diets that include plant sterol/stanol esters; 
</P>
<P>(F) The claim does not imply that consumption of diets that include plant sterol/stanol esters is the only recognized means of achieving a reduced risk of CHD; and 
</P>
<P>(G) The claim specifies the daily dietary intake of plant sterol or stanol esters that is necessary to reduce the risk of CHD and the contribution one serving of the product makes to the specified daily dietary intake level. Daily dietary intake levels of plant sterol and stanol esters that have been associated with reduced risk of are: 
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) 1.3 g or more per day of plant sterol esters.
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) 3.4 g or more per day of plant stanol esters. 
</P>
<P>(H) The claim specifies that the daily dietary intake of plant sterol or stanol esters should be consumed in two servings eaten at different times of the day with other foods. 
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Nature of the substance</I>—(A) <I>Plant sterol esters.</I> (<I>1</I>) Plant sterol esters prepared by esterifying a mixture of plant sterols from edible oils with food-grade fatty acids.

These criteria are not intended to classify as disease claims statements that refer to the ability of a product to maintain healthy structure or function, unless the statement implies disease prevention or treatment. In determining whether a statement is a disease claim under these criteria, FDA will consider the context in which the claim is presented. A statement claims to diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent disease if it claims, explicitly or implicitly, that the product:
</P>
<P>(i) Has an effect on a specific disease or class of diseases;
</P>
<P>(ii) Has an effect on the characteristic signs or symptoms of a specific disease or class of diseases, using scientific or lay terminology;
</P>
<P>(iii) Has an effect on an abnormal condition associated with a natural state or process, if the abnormal condition is uncommon or can cause significant or permanent harm;
</P>
<P>(iv) Has an effect on a disease or diseases through one or more of the following factors:
</P>
<P>(A) The name of the product;
</P>
<P>(B) A statement about the formulation of the product, including a claim that the product contains an ingredient (other than an ingredient that is an article included in the definition of “dietary supplement” under 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)) that has been regulated by FDA as a drug and is well known to consumers for its use or claimed use in preventing or treating a disease;
</P>
<P>(C) Citation of a publication or reference, if the citation refers to a disease use, and if, in the context of the labeling as a whole, the citation implies treatment or prevention of a disease, e.g., through placement on the immediate product label or packaging, inappropriate prominence, or lack of relationship to the product's express claims;
</P>
<P>(D) Use of the term “disease” or “diseased,” except in general statements about disease prevention that do not refer explicitly or implicitly to a specific disease or class of diseases or to a specific product or ingredient; or
</P>
<P>(E) Use of pictures, vignettes, symbols, or other means;
</P>
<P>(v) Belongs to a class of products that is intended to diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent a disease;
</P>
<P>(vi) Is a substitute for a product that is a therapy for a disease;
</P>
<P>(vii) Augments a particular therapy or drug action that is intended to diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent a disease or class of diseases;
</P>
<P>(viii) Has a role in the body's response to a disease or to a vector of disease;
</P>
<P>(ix) Treats, prevents, or mitigates adverse events associated with a therapy for a disease, if the adverse events constitute diseases; or

<HEAD>§ 101.95   “Fresh,” “freshly frozen,” “fresh frozen,” “frozen fresh.”</HEAD>
<P>The terms defined in this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a food in conformity with the provisions of this section. The requirements of the section pertain to any use of the subject terms as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section that expressly or implicitly refers to the food on labels or labeling, including use in a brand name and use as a sensory modifier. However, the use of the term “fresh” on labels or labeling is not subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if the term does not suggest or imply that a food is unprocessed or unpreserved. For example, the term “fresh” used to describe pasteurized whole milk is not subject to paragraph (a) of this section because the term does not imply that the food is unprocessed (consumers commonly understand that milk is nearly always pasteurized). However, the term “fresh” to describe pasta sauce that has been pasteurized or that contains pasteurized ingredients would be subject to paragraph (a) of this section because the term implies that the food is not processed or preserved. Uses of fresh not subject to this regulation will be governed by the provisions of 403(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act).
</P>
<P>(a) The term “fresh,” when used on the label or in labeling of a food in a manner that suggests or implies that the food is unprocessed, means that the food is in its raw state and has not been frozen or subjected to any form of thermal processing or any other form of preservation, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
</P>
<P>(b) The terms “fresh frozen” and “frozen fresh,” when used on the label or in labeling of a food, mean that the food was quickly frozen while still fresh (i.e., the food had been recently harvested when frozen). Blanching of the food before freezing will not preclude use of the term “fresh frozen” to describe the food. “Quickly frozen” means frozen by a freezing system such as blast-freezing (sub-zero Fahrenheit temperature with fast moving air directed at the food) that ensures the food is frozen, even to the center of the food, quickly and that virtually no deterioration has taken place.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Provisions and restrictions.</I> (1) The following do not preclude the food from use of the term “fresh:”
</P>
<P>(i) The addition of approved waxes or coatings;
</P>
<P>(ii) The post-harvest use of approved pesticides;
</P>
<P>(iii) The application of a mild chlorine wash or mild acid wash on produce; or
</P>
<P>(iv) The treatment of raw foods with ionizing radiation not to exceed the maximum dose of 1 kiloGray in accordance with § 179.26 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(2) A food meeting the definition in paragraph (a) of this section that is refrigerated is not precluded from use of “fresh” as provided by this section.

<P>(1) An assortment of different items of food, when variations in the items that make up different packages packed from such assortment normally occur in good packing practice and when such variations result in variations in the ingredients in different packages, with respect to any ingredient that is not common to all packages. Such exemption, however, shall be on the condition that the label shall bear, in conjunction with the names of such ingredients as are common to all packages, a statement (in terms that are as informative as practicable and that are not misleading) indicating by name other ingredients which may be present.
</P>
<P>(2) A food having been received in bulk containers at a retail establishment, if displayed to the purchaser with either:
</P>
<P>(i) The labeling of the bulk container plainly in view, provided ingredient information appears prominently and conspicuously in lettering of not less than one-fourth of an inch in height; or
</P>
<P>(ii) A counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously, but in no case with lettering of less than one-fourth of an inch in height, the information required to be stated on the label pursuant to section 403(i)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act).
</P>

</P>
<P>(<I>c</I>) Substances that are added to a food for their technical or functional effect in the processing but are present in the finished food at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food.
</P>
<P>(iii) Substances migrating to food from equipment or packaging or otherwise affecting food that are not food additives as defined in section 201(s) of the act; or if they are food additives as so defined, they are used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to section 409 of the act.
</P>
<P>(4) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, any sulfiting agent (sulfur dioxide, sodium sulfite, sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, and potassium metabisulfite) that has been added to any food or to any ingredient in any food and that has no technical effect in that food will be considered to be present in an insignificant amount only if no detectable amount of the agent is present in the finished food. A detectable amount of sulfiting agent is 10 parts per million (ppm or mg/kg) or more of the sulfite in the finished food. Compliance with this paragraph (a)(4) will be determined using either:
</P>
<P>(i) Determination of Sulfite in Food by Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry; or
</P>
<P>(ii) AOAC Official Method 990.28.
</P>
<P>(b) A food repackaged in a retail establishment is exempt from the following provisions of the act if the conditions specified are met.
</P>
<P>(1) Section 403(e)(1) of the act (requiring a statement on the label of the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor).
</P>
<P>(2) Section 403(g)(2) of the act (requiring the label of a food which purports to be or is represented as one for which a definition and standard of identity has been prescribed to bear the name of the food specified in the definition and standard and, insofar as may be required by the regulation establishing the standard the common names of the optional ingredients present in the food), if the food is displayed to the purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the information required by these provisions.

<P>(3) Section 403(i)(1) of the act (requiring the label to bear the common or usual name of the food), if the food is displayed to the purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the common or usual name of the food, or if the common or usual name of the food is clearly revealed by its appearance.
</P>
<P>(c) An open container (a container of rigid or semirigid construction, which is not closed by lid, wrapper, or otherwise other than by an uncolored transparent wrapper which does not obscure the contents) of a fresh fruit or fresh vegetable, the quantity of contents of which is not more than 1 dry quart, shall be exempt from the labeling requirements of sections 403(e), (g)(2) (with respect to the name of the food specified in the definition and standard), and (i)(1) of the act; but such exemption shall be on the condition that if two or more such containers are enclosed in a crate or other shipping package, such crate or package shall bear labeling showing the number of such containers enclosed therein and the quantity of the contents of each.
</P>
<P>(d) Except as provided by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, a shipment or other delivery of a food which is, in accordance with the practice of the trade, to be processed, labeled, or repacked in substantial quantity at an establishment other than that where originally processed or packed, shall be exempt, during the time of introduction into and movement in interstate commerce and the time of holding in such establishment, from compliance with the labeling requirements of section 403 (c), (e), (g), (h), (i), (k), and (q) of the act if:

<P>(1) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d) (1) or (3) of this section shall, at the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment become void ab initio if the food comprising such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act when so removed.
</P>
<P>(2) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d) (2) or (3) of this section shall become void ab initio with respect to the person who introduced such shipment or delivery into interstate commerce upon refusal by such person to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement, as required by paragraph (d) (2) or (3) of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d) (2) or (3) of this section shall expire:
</P>
<P>(i) At the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment if the food constituting such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act when so removed; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Upon refusal by the operator of the establishment where such food is to be processed, labeled, or repacked, to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement, as required by such paragraph.
</P>
<P>(f) The word “processed” as used in this paragraph shall include the holding of cheese in a suitable warehouse at a temperature of not less than 35 °F for the purpose of aging or curing to bring the cheese into compliance with requirements of an applicable definition and standard of identity. The exemptions provided for in paragraph (d) of this section shall apply to cheese which is, in accordance with the practice of the trade, shipped to a warehouse for aging or curing, on condition that the cheese is identified in the manner set forth in one of the applicable following paragraphs, and in such case the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section shall also apply:
</P>
<P>(1) In the case of varieties of cheese for which definitions and standards of identity require a period of aging whether or not they are made from pasteurized milk, each such cheese shall bear on the cheese a legible mark showing the date at which the preliminary manufacturing process has been completed and at which date curing commences, and to each cheese, on its wrapper or immediate container, shall be affixed a removable tag bearing the statement “Uncured ______ cheese for completion of curing and proper labeling”, the blank being filled in with the applicable name of the variety of cheese. In the case of swiss cheese, the date at which the preliminary manufacturing process had been completed and at which date curing commences is the date on which the shaped curd is removed from immersion in saturated salt solution as provided in the definition and standard of identity for swiss cheese, and such cheese shall bear a removable tag reading, “To be cured and labeled as ‘swiss cheese,’ but if eyes do not form, to be labeled as ‘swiss cheese for manufacturing’ ”.
</P>
<P>(2) In the case of varieties of cheeses which when made from unpasteurized milk are required to be aged for not less than 60 days, each such cheese shall bear a legible mark on the cheese showing the date at which the preliminary manufacturing process has been completed and at which date curing commences, and to each such cheese or its wrapper or immediate container shall be affixed a removable tag reading, “______ cheese made from unpasteurized milk. For completion of curing and proper labeling”, the blank being filled in with the applicable name of the variety of cheese.
</P>
<P>(3) In the case of cheddar cheese, washed curd cheese, colby cheese, granular cheese, and brick cheese made from unpasteurized milk, each such cheese shall bear a legible mark on the cheese showing the date at which the preliminary manufacturing process has been completed and at which date curing commences, and to each such cheese or its wrapper or immediate container shall be affixed a removable tag reading “______ cheese made from unpasteurized milk. For completion of curing and proper labeling, or for labeling as ______ cheese for manufacturing”, the blank being filled in with the applicable name of the variety of cheese.
</P>
<P>(g) The label declaration of a harmless marker used to identify a particular manufacturer's product may result in unfair competition through revealing a trade secret. Exemption from the label declaration of such a marker is granted, therefore, provided that the following conditions are met:
</P>
<P>(1) The person desiring to use the marker without label declaration of its presence has submitted to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs full information concerning the proposed usage and the reasons why he believes label declaration of the marker should be subject to this exemption; and
</P>
<P>(2) The person requesting the exemption has received from the Commissioner of Food and Drugs a finding that the marker is harmless and that the exemption has been granted.
</P>
<P>(h) Wrapped fish fillets of nonuniform weight intended to be unpacked and marked with the correct weight at or before the point of retail sale in an establishment other than that where originally packed shall be exempt from the requirement of section 403(e)(2) of the act during introduction and movement in interstate commerce and while held for sale prior to weighing and marking:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Provided,</I> That (i) The outside container bears a label declaration of the total net weight; and
</P>
<P>(ii) The individual packages bear a conspicuous statement “To be weighed at or before time of sale” and a correct statement setting forth the weight of the wrapper;
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Provided further,</I> That it is the practice of the retail establishment to weigh and mark the individual packages with a correct net-weight statement prior to or at the point of retail sale. A statement of the weight of the wrapper shall be set forth so as to be readily read and understood, using such term as “wrapper tare—ounce”, the blank being filled in with the correct average weight of the wrapper used.
</P>
<P>(3) The act of delivering the wrapped fish fillets during the retail sale without the correct net-weight statement shall be deemed an act which results in the product's being misbranded while held for sale. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring net-weight statements for wrapped fish fillets delivered into institutional trade provided the outside container bears the required information.
</P>
<P>(i) Wrapped clusters (consumer units) of bananas of nonuniform weight intended to be unpacked from a master carton or container and weighed at or before the point of retail sale in an establishment other than that where originally packed shall be exempt from the requirements of section 403(e)(2) of the act during introduction and movement in interstate commerce and while held for sale prior to weighing:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Provided,</I> That (i) The master carton or container bears a label declaration of the total net weight; and
</P>
<P>(ii) The individual packages bear a conspicuous statement “To be weighed at or before the time of sale” and a correct statement setting forth the weight of the wrapper; using such term as “wrapper tare __ ounce”, the blank being filled in with the correct average weight of the wrapper used;
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Provided further,</I> That it is the practice of the retail establishment to weigh the individual packages either prior to or at the time of retail sale.
</P>
<P>(3) The act of delivering the wrapped clusters (consumer units) during the retail sale without an accurate net weight statement or alternatively without weighing at the time of sale shall be deemed an act which results in the product's being misbranded while held for sale. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring net-weight statements for clusters (consumer units) delivered into institutional trade, provided that the master container or carton bears the required information.

<P>(a) The common or usual name of a food, which may be a coined term, shall accurately identify or describe, in as simple and direct terms as possible, the basic nature of the food or its characterizing properties or ingredients. The name shall be uniform among all identical or similar products and may not be confusingly similar to the name of any other food that is not reasonably encompassed within the same name. Each class or subclass of food shall be given its own common or usual name that states, in clear terms, what it is in a way that distinguishes it from different foods.
</P>
<P>(b) The common or usual name of a food shall include the percentage(s) of any characterizing ingredient(s) or component(s) when the proportion of such ingredient(s) or component(s) in the food has a material bearing on price or consumer acceptance or when the labeling or the appearance of the food may otherwise create an erroneous impression that such ingredient(s) or component(s) is present in an amount greater than is actually the case. The following requirements shall apply unless modified by a specific regulation in subpart B of this part.

<HEAD>Subpart B—Fortification Policy</HEAD>


<DIV8 N="104.20" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="2">
<HEAD>§ 104.20   Statement of purpose.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The fundamental objective of this subpart is to establish a uniform set of principles that will serve as a model for the rational addition of nutrients to foods. The achievement and maintenance of a desirable level of nutritional quality in the nation's food supply is an important public health objective. The addition of nutrients to specific foods can be an effective way of maintaining and improving the overall nutritional quality of the food supply. However, random fortification of foods could result in over- or underfortification in consumer diets and create nutrient imbalances in the food supply. It could also result in deceptive or misleading claims for certain foods. The Food and Drug Administration does not encourage indiscriminate addition of nutrients to foods, nor does it consider it appropriate to fortify fresh produce; meat, poultry, or fish products; sugars; or snack foods such as candies and carbonated beverages. To preserve a balance of nutrients in the diet, manufacturers who elect to fortify foods are urged to utilize these principles when adding nutrients to food. It is reasonable to anticipate that the Reference Daily Intakes (RDI's) as delineated in § 101.9 of this chapter and in paragraph (d) of this section will be amended from time to time to list additional nutrients and/or to change the levels of specific RDI's as improved knowledge about human nutrient requirements and allowances develops. The policy set forth in this section is based on U.S. dietary practices and nutritional needs and may not be applicable in other countries.
</P>
<P>(b) A nutrient(s) listed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section may appropriately be added to a food to correct a dietary insufficiency recognized by the scientific community to exist and known to result in nutritional deficiency disease if:
</P>
<P>(1) Sufficient information is available to identify the nutritional problem and the affected population groups, and the food is suitable to act as a vehicle for the added nutrients. Manufacturers contemplating using this principle are urged to contact the Food and Drug Administration before implementing a fortification plan based on this principle.
</P>
<P>(2) The food is not the subject of any other Federal regulation for a food or class of food that requires, permits, or prohibits nutrient additions. (Other Federal regulations include, but are not limited to, standards of identity promulgated under section 401 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, nutritional quality guidelines established in subpart C of this part, and common or usual name regulations established in part 102 of this chapter.)
</P>
<P>(c) A nutrient(s) listed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section may appropriately be added to a food to restore such nutrient(s) to a level(s) representative of the food prior to storage, handling, and processing, when:
</P>
<P>(1) The nutrient is shown by adequate scientific documentation to have been lost in storage, handling, or processing in a measurable amount equal to at least 2 percent of the Daily Reference Value (DRV) of protein and of potassium and 2 percent of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) in a normal serving of the food.
</P>
<P>(2) Good manufacturing practices and normal storage and handling procedures cannot prevent the loss of such nutrient(s),
</P>
<P>(3) All nutrients, including protein, iodine and vitamin D, that are lost in a measurable amount are restored and all ingredients of the food product that contribute nutrients are considered in determining restoration levels; and
</P>
<P>(4) The food is not the subject of any other Federal regulation that requires or prohibits nutrient addition(s), or the food has not been fortified in accordance with any other Federal regulation that permits voluntary nutrient additions.
</P>
<P>(d) A nutrient(s) listed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section may be added to a food in proportion to the total caloric content of the food, to balance the vitamin, mineral, and protein content if:
</P>
<P>(1) A normal serving of the food contains at least 40 kilocalories (that is, 2 percent of a daily intake of 2,000 kilocalories);
</P>
<P>(2) The food is not the subject of any other Federal regulation for a food or class of food that requires, permits, or prohibits nutrient additions; and
</P>
<P>(3) The food contains all of the following nutrients per 100 calories based on 2,000 calorie total intake as a daily standard:

<P>(a) During manufacture, a manufacturer shall test each production aggregate for nutrients as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) Each nutrient premix used in the manufacture of an infant formula shall be tested for each nutrient (required under § 107.100 of this chapter or otherwise added by the manufacturer) that the manufacturer is relying on the premix to provide, to ensure that the premix is in compliance with the manufacturer's specifications;
</P>
<P>(2) During the manufacturing process, after the addition of the premix, or at the final product stage but before distribution, each production aggregate of infant formula shall be tested for at least one indicator nutrient for each of the nutrient premixes used in the infant formula to confirm that the nutrients supplied by each of the premixes are present, in the proper concentration, in the production aggregate of infant formula.
</P>
<P>(3) At the final product stage, before distribution of an infant formula, each production aggregate shall be tested for vitamins A, C, E, and thiamin.
</P>
<P>(4) During the manufacturing process or at the final product stage, before distribution, each production aggregate shall be tested for all nutrients required to be included in such formula under § 107.100 of this chapter for which testing is not conducted for compliance with paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this section and for any nutrient added by the manufacturer for which testing is not conducted for compliance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
</P>
<P>(b) A manufacturer shall test each production aggregate of finished product for nutrients as follows:
</P>
<P>(1)(i) For an infant formula that is a new infant formula the manufacturer shall collect, from each manufacturing site and at the final product stage, a representative sample of the first production aggregate of packaged, finished formula in each physical form (powder, ready-to-feed, or concentrate) and evaluate the levels of all nutrients required under § 107.100 of this chapter and all other nutrients added by the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall repeat such testing every 4 months thereafter throughout the shelf life of the product.
</P>
<P>(ii) The Food and Drug Administration will exempt the manufacturer from the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section if the manufacturer of a new infant formula requests an exemption and provides analytical data, as required under § 106.120(b)(7), that demonstrates that the stability of the new infant formula will likely not differ from the stability of formulas with similar composition, processing, and packaging for which there are extensive stability data. A manufacturer exempt from the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section would be required to test the first production aggregate according to the requirements of § 106.91(b)(2).
</P>
<P>(2) The manufacturer shall collect, from each manufacturing site and at the final product stage, a representative sample of each subsequent production aggregate of packaged, finished formula in each physical form (powder, ready-to-feed, or concentrate) and evaluate the levels of all nutrients required under § 107.100 of this chapter and all other nutrients added by the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall repeat such testing at the end of the shelf life of the product.
</P>
<P>(3) If the results of the testing required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not substantiate the shelf life of the infant formula, the manufacturer shall address, as appropriate, all production aggregates of formula released and pending release for distribution that are implicated by the testing results, such as by conducting the testing required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section on a subsequently produced production aggregate to substantiate the shelf life of the infant formula or revising the use by date for such product so that such date is substantiated by the stability testing results.
</P>
<P>(4) If results of the testing required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section show that any required nutrient is not present in the production aggregate of infant formula at the level required by § 107.100 of this chapter or that any nutrient added by the manufacturer is not present at the level declared on the label of the production aggregate of infant formula, the manufacturer shall:
</P>
<P>(i) Investigate the cause of such variance in the level of any required or added nutrient;
</P>
<P>(ii) Evaluate the significance, if any, of the results for other production aggregates of the same formula that have been released for distribution;
</P>
<P>(iii) Address, as appropriate, all production aggregates of formula released and pending release for distribution that are implicated by the testing results; and
</P>
<P>(iv) Determine whether it is necessary to conduct the testing required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
</P>
<P>(5) The testing required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section is not required to evaluate the level of minerals present in the infant formula.
</P>

</P>
<P>(ii) Those complaints that may involve a possible existence of a hazard to health but do not refer to an infant becoming ill or the need for treatment by physician or a health care provider.
</P>
<P>(5) The manufacturer shall include in a complaint file the following information concerning the complaint:
</P>
<P>(i) The name of the infant formula;
</P>
<P>(ii) The production aggregate number;
</P>
<P>(iii) The name of complainant;

<P>(iv) A copy of the complaint or a memo of the telephone conversation or meeting and all correspondence with the complainant;
</P>
<P>(v) By reference or copy, all the associated manufacturing records and complaint investigation records needed to evaluate the complaint. When copies of such records are not maintained in the complaint file, they must be available within 24 hours when requested by a Food and Drug Administration official.
</P>
<P>(vi) All actions taken to followup on the complaint; and
</P>
<P>(vii) All findings and evaluations of the complaint.
</P>
<P>(6) The manufacturer should maintain the files regarding infant formula complaints at the establishment where the infant formula was manufactured, processed, or packed. When the manufacturer wishes to maintain all consumer complaints for the entire firm at one location other than at the facility where an infant formula was manufactured, processed, or packed, the manufacturer may do so as long as all records required by this section are available within 24 hours of request for inspection at that facility. However, all records of consumer complaints, including summaries, any reports, and any files, maintained at the manufacturing facility or at any other facility shall be made available to investigators for review and copying upon request.
</P>
<P>(l) The manufacturer shall make readily available for authorized inspection all records required under this part or copies of such records. Records shall be available at any reasonable time at the establishment where the activities described in such records occurred. (Infant formula complaint files may be maintained at one facility, as provided in paragraph (k)(6) of this section, if all required records are readily available at that facility.) These records or copies thereof shall be subject to photocopying or other means of reproduction as part of such inspection. Records that can be immediately retrieved from another location by electronic means shall be considered as meeting the requirements of this paragraph.
</P>
<P>(m) A manufacturer shall maintain all records required under this part in a manner that ensures that both the manufacturer and the Food and Drug Administration can be provided with access to such records within 24 hours. The manufacturer may maintain the records required under this part as original records, as true copies such as photocopies, microfilm, microfiche, or other accurate reproductions of the original records, or as electronic records. Where reduction techniques, such as microfilming, are used, suitable reader and photocopying equipment shall be readily available. All electronic records maintained under this part shall comply with part 11 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(n) Production control, product testing, testing results, complaints, and distribution records necessary to verify compliance with parts 106, 107, 109, 110, 113, and 117 of this chapter, or with other appropriate regulations, shall be retained for 1 year after the expiration of the shelf life of the infant formula or 3 years from the date of manufacture, whichever is greater.

<HEAD>Subpart C—Exempt Infant Formulas</HEAD>


<DIV8 N="107.50" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="2">
<HEAD>§ 107.50   Terms and conditions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Terms and conditions.</I> Section 412(f)(1) of the act exempts from the requirements of section 412(a), (b), and (c)(1)(A) of the act infant formulas that are represented and labeled for use by an infant who has an inborn error of metabolism or low birth weight or who otherwise has an unusual medical or dietary problem, if such formulas comply with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. The regulations in this subpart establish the terms and conditions that a manufacturer must meet with respect to such infant formulas.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Infant formulas generally available at the retail level.</I> (1) These exempt infant formulas can generally be purchased from retail store shelves that are readily available to the public. Such formulas are also typically represented and labeled for use to provide dietary management for diseases or conditions that are not clinically serious or life-threatening, even though such formulas may also be represented and labeled for use in clinically serious or life-threatening disorders.
</P>
<P>(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section, an infant formula manufacturer shall, with respect to each formula covered by this paragraph, comply with the nutrient requirements of section 412(g) of the act or of regulations promulgated under section 412(a)(2) of the act, the quality control procedure requirements of part 106, and the labeling requirements of subpart B of this part.
</P>
<P>(3) To retain the exempt status of an infant formula covered by this paragraph, the manufacturer shall submit to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), at the address specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, on or before May 21, 1986, or on or before the 90th day before the first processing of the infant formula for commercial or charitable distribution, whichever occurs later, the label and other labeling of the infant formula, a complete quantitative formulation for the infant formula, and a detailed description of the medical conditions for which the infant formula is represented. FDA will review the information under paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P>(4) To retain the exempt status of an infant formula covered by this paragraph, when any change in ingredients or processes that may result in an adverse impact on levels of nutrients or availability of nutrients is instituted, the manufacturer shall submit to FDA at the address specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, before the first processing of the infant formula, the label and other labeling of the infant formula, a complete quantitative formulation for the infant formula, a detailed description of the reformulation and the rationale for the reformulation, a complete description of the change in processing, and a detailed description of the medical conditions for which the infant formula is represented. FDA will review that information under paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P>(5) A manufacturer may deviate from the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section only with respect to those specific requirements for which it submits to FDA, at the address specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the medical, nutritional, scientific, or technological rationale (including any appropriate animal or human clinical studies). FDA will review that information under paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Infant formulas not generally available at the retail level.</I> (1) These exempt infant formulas are not generally found on retail shelves for general consumer purchase. Such formulas typically are prescribed by a physician, and must be requested from a pharmacist or are distributed directly to institutions such as hospitals, clinics, and State or Federal agencies. Such formulas are also generally represented and labeled solely to provide dietary management for specific diseases or conditions that are clinically serious or life-threatening and generally are required for prolonged periods of time. Exempt infant formulas distributed directly to institutions such as hospitals, clinics, and State or Federal agencies that are of the same formulation as those generally available at the retail level are subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section rather than to the requirements of this paragraph.
</P>
<P>(2) Except as provided for in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, an infant formula manufacturer shall, with respect to each formula covered by this paragraph, comply with the nutrient requirements of section 412(g) of the act or of regulations promulgated under section 412(a)(2) of the act, and the labeling requirements of subpart B of this part.
</P>
<P>(3) Each manufacturer of an infant formula covered by this paragraph shall establish quality control procedures designed to ensure that the infant formula meets applicable nutrient requirements of this section, including any special nutritional characteristics for the specific disorders or conditions for which the formula is represented for use. Each manufacturer shall maintain records of such quality control procedures sufficient to permit a public health evaluation of each manufactured batch of infant formula and shall permit any authorized FDA employee at all reasonable times to have access to and to copy and verify the records referred to in this paragraph.
</P>
<P>(4) To retain the exempt status of an infant formula covered by this paragraph, the manufacturer shall submit the information required by paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section.
</P>
<P>(5) A manufacturer may deviate from the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section only with respect to those specific requirements for which it submits to FDA, at the address specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the medical, nutritional, scientific, or technological rationale (including any appropriate animal or human clinical studies). FDA will review that information under paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P>(6) The requirements of this section do not apply to an infant formula specially and individually prepared for one or more specific infants on a physician's request.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>FDA review of exempt status.</I> (1) FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition will review information submitted by infant formula manufacturers under paragraph (b) (3), (b) (4), or (c)(4) of this section. On the basis of such review and other information available to the agency, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition may impose additional conditions on, or modify requirements for, the quality control procedures, nutrient specifications, or labeling of an infant formula, or withdraw a product's exempt status. Such determinations will be made by the Director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.
</P>
<P>(2)(i) If after completing its review of all information submitted, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition concludes that additional or modified quality control, nutrient, or labeling requirements are needed, or that a product's exempt status is withdrawn, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition will so notify the manufacturer and this notification will specify the reasons therefor. Upon receipt of this notification, the manufacturer has 10 working days to have the decision reviewed under § 10.75 by the office of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. A determination by the Director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition that is not appealed becomes a final agency decision.
</P>
<P>(ii) After a final decision by the Director or by the office of the Commissioner that a product's exempt status is withdrawn, the manufacturer shall comply with the nutrient requirements of section 412(g) of the act or of regulations promulgated under section 412(a)(2) of the act, the quality control requirements of part 106, and the labeling requirements of subpart B of this part.
</P>
<P>(iii) The compliance date for the withdrawal of a product's exempt status or the imposition of additional or modified quality control, nutrient, or labeling requirements is 60 calendar days after issuance of the final decision except as otherwise provided for reasons stated in the decision. If the agency determines that a health hazard may exist and so notifies the manufacturer, withdrawal of a product's exempt status shall be effective on the date of receipt of notification from the Director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Additional or modified requirements, or the withdrawal of an exemption, apply only to those formulas that are manufactured after the compliance date. A postponement of the compliance date may be granted for good cause.
</P>
<P>(3) FDA may decide that withdrawal of an exemption is necessary when, on the basis of its review under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, it concludes that quality control procedures are not adequate to ensure that the formula contains all required nutrients, that deviations in nutrient levels are not supported by generally accepted scientific, nutritional, or medical rationale, or that deviations from subpart B of this part are not necessary to provide appropriate directions for preparation and use of the infant formula, or that additional labeling information is necessary.
</P>
<P>(4) FDA will use the following criteria in determining whether deviations from the requirements of this subpart are necessary and will adequately protect the public health:
</P>
<P>(i) A deviation from the nutrient requirements of section 412(g) of the act or of regulations promulgated under section 412(a)(2) of the act is necessary to provide an infant formula that is appropriate for the dietary management of a specific disease, disorder, or medical condition;
</P>
<P>(ii) For exempt infant formulas subject to paragraph (b) of this section, a deviation from the quality control procedures requirements of part 106 is necessary because of unusual or difficult technological problems in manufacturing the infant formula; and
</P>
<P>(iii) A deviation from the labeling requirements of subpart B of this part is necessary because label information, including pictograms and symbols required by those regulations, could lead to inappropriate use of the product.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Notification requirements.</I> (1) Information required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Office of Nutrition, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements, Infant Formula and Medical Foods Staff (HFS-850), Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740.
</P>
<P>(2) The manufacturer shall promptly notify the Food and Drug Administration when the manufacturer has knowledge (as defined in section 412(c)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) that reasonably supports the conclusion that an exempt infant formula that has been processed by the manufacturer and that has left an establishment subject to the control of the manufacturer may not provide the nutrients required by paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, or when there is an exempt infant formula that may be otherwise adulterated or misbranded and if so adulterated or misbranded presents a risk of human health. This notification shall be made, by telephone, to the Director of the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office specified in part 5, subpart M of this chapter. After normal business hours (8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.), contact the Food and Drug Administration Emergency Call Center at 866-300-4374. The manufacturer shall send a followup written confirmation to the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-605), Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, and to the appropriate FDA district office specified in part 5, subpart M of this chapter.

This health hazard evaluation shall include consideration of any disease, injury, or other adverse physiological effect that has been or that could be caused by the infant formula and of the seriousness, likelihood, and consequences of the diseases, injury, or other adverse physiological effect. The Food and Drug Administration will conduct its own health hazard evaluation and promptly notify the recalling firm of the results of that evaluation if the criteria for recall under § 107.200 have been met.
</P>
<P>(b) The recalling firm shall devise a written recall strategy suited to the individual circumstances of the particular recall. The recall strategy shall take into account the health hazard evaluation and specify the following: The extent of the recall; if necessary, the public warning to be given about any hazard presented by the infant formula; the disposition of the recalled infant formula; and the effectiveness checks that will be made to determine that the recall is carried out.
</P>
<P>(c) The recalling firm shall promptly notify each of its affected direct accounts about the recall. The format of a recall communication shall be distinctive, and the content and extent of a recall communication shall be commensurate with the hazard of the infant formula being recalled and the strategy developed for the recall. The recall communication shall instruct consignees to report back quickly to the recalling firm about whether they are in possession of the recalled infant formula and shall include a means of doing so. The recalled communication shall also advise consignees how to return the recall infant formula to the manufacturer or otherwise dispose of it. The recalling firm shall send a followup recall communication to any consignee that does not respond to the initial recall communication.
</P>
<P>(d) If the infant formula presents a risk to human health, the recalling firm shall request that each establishment, at which such infant formula is sold or available for sale, post at the point of purchase of such formula a notice of such recall at such establishment. The notice shall be provided by the recalling firm after approval of the notice by the Food and Drug Administration. The recalling firm shall also request that each retail establishment maintain such notice on display until such time as the Food and Drug Administration notifies the recalling firm that the agency considers the recall completed.
</P>
<P>(e) The recalling firm shall furnish promptly to the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office listed in part 5, subpart M of this chapter, as they are available, copies of the health hazard evaluation, the recall strategy, and all recall communications (including, for a recall under § 107.200, the notice to be displayed at retail establishments) directed to consignees, distributors, retailers, and members of the public.

<HEAD>§ 108.25   Acidified foods.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Inadequate or improper manufacture, processing, or packing of acidified foods may result in the distribution in interstate commerce of processed foods that may be injurious to health. The harmful nature of such foods cannot be adequately determined after these foods have entered into interstate commerce. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs therefore finds that, to protect the public health, it may be necessary to require any commercial processor, in any establishment engaged in the manufacture, processing, or packing of acidified foods, to obtain and hold a temporary emergency permit provided for under section 404 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Such a permit may be required whenever the Commissioner finds, after investigation, that the commercial processor has failed to fulfill all the requirements of this section, including registration and filing of process information, and the mandatory portions of §§ 114.10, 114.80(a) (1) and (2), and (b), 114.83, 114.89, and 114.100 (b), (c), and (d) of this chapter as they relate to acidified foods. These requirements are intended to ensure safe manufacturing, processing, and packing processes and to permit the Food and Drug Administration to verify that these processes are being followed.

<HEAD>§ 108.35   Thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Inadequate or improper manufacture, processing, or packing of thermally processed low-acid foods in hermetically sealed containers may result in the distribution in interstate commerce of processed foods that may be injurious to health. The harmful nature of such foods cannot be adequately determined after these foods have entered into interstate commerce. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs therefore finds that, in order to protect the public health, it may be necessary to require any commercial processor, in any establishment engaged in the manufacture, processing, or packing of thermally processed low-acid foods in hermetically sealed containers, to obtain and hold a temporary emergency permit provided for under section 404 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Such a permit may be required whenever the Commissioner finds, after investigation, that the commercial processor has failed to fulfill all the requirements of this section, including registration and the filing of process information, and the mandatory portions of part 113 of this chapter. These requirements are intended to ensure safe manufacture, processing, and packing procedures and to permit the Food and Drug Administration to verify that these procedures are being followed. Such failure shall constitute a prima facie basis for the immediate application of the emergency permit control provisions of section 404 of the act to that establishment, pursuant to the procedures established in subpart A of this part.
</P>
<P>(b) The definitions in § 113.3 of this chapter are applicable when such terms are used in this section.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Registration and process filing</I>—(1) <I>Registration.</I> A commercial processor when first engaging in the manufacture, processing, or packing of thermally processed low-acid foods in hermetically sealed containers in any State, as defined in section 201(a)(1) of the act, shall, not later than 10 days after first so engaging, register with the Food and Drug Administration on Form FDA 2541 (food canning establishment registration) information including (but not limited to) his name, principal place of business, the location of each establishment in which such processing is carried on, the processing method in terms of the type of processing equipment employed, and a list of the low-acid foods so processed in each such establishment. These forms are available from the LACF Registration Coordinator (HFS-303), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, or at any Food and Drug Administration district office. The completed form shall be submitted to the LACF Registration Coordinator (HFS-618), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740. These forms also are available on the Food and Drug Administration's Web site at <I>http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/FoodFacilityRegistration/AcidifiedLACFRegistration/default.htm.</I> For electronic submission go to FDA's Industry Systems Web site at <I>www.access.fda.gov.</I> Commercial processors duly registered in accordance with this section shall notify the Food and Drug Administration not later than 90 days after such commercial processor ceases or discontinues the manufacture, processing, or packing of thermally processed foods in any establishment: <I>Provided,</I> that such notification shall not be required as to the temporary cessation necessitated by the seasonal character of the particular establishment's production or caused by temporary conditions including but not limited to strikes, lockouts, fire, or acts of God.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Process filing.</I> A commercial processor engaged in the thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers shall, not later than 60 days after registration and prior to the packing of a new product, provide the Food and Drug Administration information as to the scheduled processes including but not limited to the processing method, type of retort or other thermal processing equipment employed, minimum initial temperatures, times and temperatures of processing, sterilizing value (Fo), or other equivalent scientific evidence of process adequacy, critical control factors affecting heat penetration, and source and date of the establishment of the process, for each such low-acid food in each container size: <I>Provided,</I> that the filing of such information does not constitute approval of the information by the Food and Drug Administration, and that information concerning processes and other data so filed shall be regarded as trade secrets within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 331(j) and 18 U.S.C. 1905. This information shall be submitted on the following forms as appropriate: Form FDA 2541d (Food Process Filing for Low-Acid Retorted Method), Form FDA 2541f (Food Process Filing for Water Activity/Formulation Control Method), or Form FDA 2541g (Food Process Filing for Low-Acid Aseptic Systems). These forms are available from the LACF Registration Coordinator (HFS-303), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, or at any Food and Drug Administration district office. The completed form(s) shall be submitted to the LACF Registration Coordinator (HFS-303), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740. These forms also are available on the Food and Drug Administration's Web site at <I>http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/FoodFacilityRegistration/AcidifiedLACFRegistration/default.htm.</I> For electronic submission, go to FDA's Industry Systems Web site at <I>www.access.fda.gov.</I>
</P>
<P>(i) If all the necessary information is not available for existing products, the processor shall, at the time the existing information is provided to the Food and Drug Administration request in writing an extension of time for submission of such information, specifying what additional information is to be supplied and the date by which it is to be submitted. Within 30 working days after receipt of such request the Food and Drug Administration shall either grant or deny such request in writing.
</P>
<P>(ii) If a packer intentionally makes a change in a previously filed scheduled process by reducing the initial temperature or retort temperature, reducing the time of processing, or changing the product formulation, the container, or any other condition basic to the adequacy of scheduled process, he shall prior to using such changed process obtain substantiation by qualified scientific authority as to its adequacy. Such substantiation may be obtained by telephone, telegram, or other media, but must be promptly recorded, verified in writing by the authority, and contained in the packer's files for review by the Food and Drug Administration. Within 30 days after first use, the packer shall submit to the LACF Registration Coordinator (HFS-303), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740 a complete description of the modifications made and utilized, together with a copy of his file record showing prior substantiation by a qualified scientific authority as to the safety of the changed process. Any intentional change of a previously filed scheduled process or modification thereof in which the change consists solely of a higher initial temperature, a higher retort temperature, or a longer processing time, shall not be considered a change subject to this paragraph, but if that modification is thereafter to be regularly scheduled, the modified process shall be promptly filed as a scheduled process, accompanied by full information on the specified forms as provided in this paragraph.
</P>
<P>(iii) Many packers employ an “operating” process in which retort operators are instructed to use retort temperatures and/or processing times slightly in excess of those specified in the scheduled process as a safety factor to compensate for minor fluctuations in temperature or time to assure that the minimum times and temperatures in the scheduled process are always met. This would not constitute a modification of the scheduled process.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Process adherence and information.</I> (i) A commercial processor engaged in the thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers in any registered establishment shall process each low-acid food in each container size in conformity with at least the scheduled processes and modifications filed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) Process information availability: When requested by the Food and Drug Administration in writing, a commercial processor engaged in thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers shall provide the Food and Drug Administration with any information concerning processes and procedures which is deemed necessary by the Food and Drug Administration to determine the adequacy of the process: <I>Provided,</I> That the furnishing of such information does not constitute approval of the information by the Food and Drug Administration, and that the information concerning processes and other data so furnished shall be regarded as trade secrets within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 331(j) and 18 U.S.C. 1905.
</P>
<P>(d) A commercial processor engaged in the thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers shall promptly report to the Food and Drug Administration any instance of spoilage or process deviation the nature of which indicates potential health significance where any lot of such food has in whole or in part entered distribution.
</P>
<P>(e) A commercial processor engaged in thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers shall promptly report to the Food and Drug Administration any instance wherein any lot of such food, which may be injurious to health by reason of contamination with microorganisms, has in whole or in part entered distribution.
</P>
<P>(f) A commercial processor engaged in the thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers shall have prepared and in his files a current procedure which he will use for products under his control and which he will ask his distributor to follow, including plans for effecting recalls of any product that may be injurious to health; for identifying, collecting, warehousing, and controlling the product; for determining the effectiveness of such recall; for notifying the Food and Drug Administration of any such recall; and for implementing such recall program.
</P>
<P>(g) All operators of retorts, thermal processing systems, aseptic processing and packaging systems, or other thermal processing systems, and container closure inspectors shall be under the operating supervision of a person who has attended a school approved by the Commissioner for giving instruction in retort operations, aseptic processing and packaging systems operations or other thermal processing systems operations, and container closure inspections, and has satisfactorily completed the prescribed course of instruction: <I>Provided,</I> That this requirement shall not apply in the State of California as listed in paragraph (j) of this section. The Commissioner will not withhold approval of any school qualified to give such instruction.
</P>
<P>(h) A commercial processor engaged in the thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers shall prepare, review, and retain at the processing plant for a period of not less than one year, and at the processing plant or other reasonably accessible location for an additional two years, all records of processing, deviations in processing, container closure inspections, and other records specified in part 113 of this chapter. If during the first year of the three-year record retention period the processing plant is closed for a prolonged period between seasonal packs, the records may be transferred to some other reasonably accessible location at the end of the seasonal pack. Upon written demand during the course of a factory inspection pursuant to section 704 of the act by a duly authorized employee of the Food and Drug Administration, a commercial processor shall permit the inspection and copying by such employee of these records to verify the adequacy of processing, the integrity of container closures, and the coding of the products.
</P>
<P>(i) This section shall not apply to the commercial processing of any food processed under the continuous inspection of the meat and poultry inspection program of the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (34 Stat. 1256, as amended by 81 Stat. 584 (21 U.S.C. 601 <I>et seq.</I>)) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (71 Stat. 441, as amended by 82 Stat. 791 (21 U.S.C. 451 <I>et seq.</I>)).
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Compliance with State regulations.</I> (1) Wherever the Commissioner finds that any State regulates the commercial thermal processing of low-acid foods in accordance with effective regulations specifying at least the requirements of part 113 of this chapter, he shall issue a notice stating that compliance with such State regulations shall constitute compliance with part 113 of this chapter. However, the provisions of this section shall remain applicable to the commercial processing of low-acid foods in any such State, except that, either the State through its regulatory agency or each processor of low-acid foods in such State shall file with the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition the registration information and the processing information prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) The Commissioner finds that the regulations adopted by the State of California under the laws relating to cannery inspections governing thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers satisfy the requirements of part 113 of this chapter.
</P>
<FP>Accordingly, processors, who under the laws relating to cannery inspections are licensed by the State of California and who comply with such state regulations, shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of part 113 of this chapter.
</FP>
<P>(k) <I>Imports.</I> (1) This section shall apply to any foreign commercial processor engaged in the thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers and offering such foods for import into the United States except that, in lieu of providing for the issuance of an emergency permit under paragraph (a) of this section, the Commissioner will request the Secretary of the Treasury to refuse admission into the United States, pursuant to section 801 of the act, of any such low-acid foods which the Commissioner determines, after investigation, may result in the distribution in interstate commerce of processed foods that may be injurious to health as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) Any such food refused admission shall not be admitted until such time as the Commissioner may determine that the commercial processor offering the food for import is in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this section and that such food is not injurious to health. For the purpose of making such determination, the Commissioner reserves the right for a duly authorized employee of the Food and Drug Administration to inspect the commercial processor's manufacturing, processing, and packing facilities.
</P>
<P>(l) The following data and information submitted to the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to this section are not available for public disclosure unless they have been previously disclosed to the public as defined in § 20.81 of this chapter or they relate to a product or ingredient that has been abandoned and they no longer represent a trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information as defined in § 20.81 of this chapter:

<P>The food additive combustion product gas may be safely used in the processing and packaging of the foods designated in paragraph (c) of this section for the purpose of removing and displacing oxygen in accordance with the following prescribed conditions: 
</P>
<P>(a) The food additive is manufactured by the controlled combustion in air of butane, propane, or natural gas. The combustion equipment shall be provided with an absorption-type filter capable of removing possible toxic impurities, through which all gas used in the treatment of food shall pass; and with suitable controls to insure that any combustion products failing to meet the specifications provided in this section will be prevented from reaching the food being treated.
</P>
<P>(b) The food additive meets the following specifications:
</P>
<P>(1) Carbon monoxide content not to exceed 4.5 percent by volume.
</P>
<P>(2) The ultraviolet absorbance in isooctane solution in the range 255 millimicrons to 310 millimicrons not to exceed one-third of the standard reference absorbance when tested as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
</P>
<P>(c) It is used or intended for use to displace or remove oxygen in the processing, storage, or packaging of beverage products and other food, except fresh meats.
</P>
<P>(d) To assure safe use of the additive in addition to the other information required by the act, the label or labeling of the combustion device shall bear adequate directions for use to provide a combustion product gas that complies with the limitations prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, including instructions to assure proper filtration.
</P>
<P>(e) The food additive is tested for compliance with paragraph (b)(2) by the following empirical method:
</P>
<EXTRACT>
<P><I>Spectrophotometric measurements.</I> All measurements are made in an ultraviolet spectrophotometer in optical cells of 5 centimeters in length, and in the range of 255 millimicrons to 310 millimicrons, under the same instrumental conditions. The standard reference absorbance is the absorbance at 275 millimicrons of a standard reference solution of naphthalene (National Bureau of Standards Material No. 577 or equivalent in purity) containing a concentration of 1.4 milligrams per liter in purified isooctane, measured against isooctane of the same spectral purity in 5-centimeter cells. (This absorbance will be approximately 0.30.)
</P>
<P><I>Solvent.</I> The solvent used is pure grade isooctane having an ultraviolet absorbance not to exceed 0.05 measured against distilled water as a reference. Upon passage of purified inert gas through some isooctane under the identical conditions of the test, a lowering of the absorbance value has been observed. The absorbance of isooctane to be used in this procedure shall not be more than 0.02 lower in the range 255 millimicrons to 310 millimicrons, inclusive, than that of the untreated solvent as measured in a 5-centimeter cell. If necessary to obtain the prescribed purities, the isooctane may be passed through activated silica gel.
</P>
<P><I>Apparatus.</I> To assure reproducible results, the additive is passed into the isooctane solution through a gas-absorption train consisting of the following components and necessary connections:
</P>
<P>1. A gas flow meter with a range up to 30 liters per hour provided with a constant differential relay or other device to maintain a constant flow rate independent of the input pressure.
</P>
<P>2. An absorption apparatus consisting of an inlet gas dispersion tube inserted to the bottom of a covered cylindrical vessel with a suitable outlet on the vessel for effluent gas. The dimensions and arrangement of tube and vessel are such that the inlet tube introduces the gas at a point not above 5
<FR>1/4</FR> inches below the surface of the solvent through a sintered glass outlet. The dimensions of the vessel are such, and both inlet and vessel are so designed, that the gas can be bubbled through 60 milliliters of isooctane solvent at a rate up to 30 liters per hour without mechanical loss of solvent. The level corresponding to 60 milliliters should be marked on the vessel.
</P>
<P>3. A cooling bath containing crushed ice and water to permit immersion of the absorption vessel at least to the solvent level mark.
</P>
<P><I>Caution.</I> The various parts of the absorption train must be connected by gas-tight tubing and joints composed of materials which will neither remove components from nor add components to the gas stream. The gas source is connected in series to the flow-rate device, the flow meter, and the absorption apparatus in that order. Ventilation should be provided for the effluent gases which may contain carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P><I>Sampling procedure.</I> Immerse the gas-absorption apparatus containing 60 milliliters of isooctane in the coolant bath so that the solvent is completely immersed. Cool for at least 15 minutes and then pass 120 liters of the test gas through the absorption train at a rate of 30 liters per hour or less. Maintain the coolant bath at 0 °C throughout. Remove the absorption vessel from the bath, disconnect, and warm to room temperature. Add isooctane to bring the contents of the absorption vessel to 60 milliliters, and mix. Determine the absorbance of the solution in the 5-centimeter cell in the range 255 millimicrons to 310 millimicrons, inclusive, compared to isooctane. The absorbance of the solution of combustion product gas shall not exceed that of the isooctane solvent at any wavelength in the specified range by more than one-third of the standard reference absorbance.</P></EXTRACT>

For the purpose of this part and parts 175, 176, and 177 of this chapter, good manufacturing practice shall be defined to include the following restrictions:
</P>
<P>(1) The quantity of any food additive substance that may be added to food as a result of use in articles that contact food shall not exceed, where no limits are specified, that which results from use of the substance in an amount not more than reasonably required to accomplish the intended physical or technical effect in the food-contact article; shall not exceed any prescribed limitations; and shall not be intended to accomplish any physical or technical effect in the food itself, except as such may be permitted by regulations in parts 170 through 189 of this chapter. 
</P>
<P>(2) Any substance used as a component of articles that contact food shall be of a purity suitable for its intended use.
</P>
<P>(b) The existence in the subchapter B of a regulation prescribing safe conditions for the use of a substance as an article or component of articles that contact food shall not be construed to relieve such use of the substance or article from compliance with any other provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. For example, if a regulated food-packaging material were found on appropriate test to impart odor or taste to a specific food product such as to render it unfit within the meaning of section 402(a)(3) of the Act, the regulation would not be construed to relieve such use from compliance with section 402(a)(3).
</P>
<P>(c) The existence in this subchapter B of a regulation prescribing safe conditions for the use of a substance as an article or component of articles that contact food shall not be construed as implying that such substance may be safely used as a direct additive in food.
</P>
<P>(d) Substances that under conditions of good manufacturing practice may be safely used as components of articles that contact food include the following, subject to any prescribed limitations:
</P>
<P>(1) Substances generally recognized as safe in or on food.
</P>
<P>(2) Substances generally recognized as safe for their intended use in food packaging.
</P>
<P>(3) Substances used in accordance with a prior sanction or approval.

<HEAD>§ 250.11   Thyroid-containing drug preparations intended for treatment of obesity in humans.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Investigation by the Food and Drug Administration has revealed that a large number of drug preparations containing thyroid or thyrogenic substances in combination with central nervous system stimulants, with or without one or more additional drug substances such as barbiturates or laxatives, are being marketed for or as adjuncts to the treatment, control, or management of obesity in humans. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs finds that the administration of such combinations for said purposes is without medical rationale except possibly in those relatively uncommon instances where the condition is directly related to hypothyroidism and there exists a concurrent need for appetite control (in such instances the safety and effectiveness of such combinations are not generally recognized). In particular, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs finds that neither the consensus of informed medical opinion nor clinical experience justifies any representation that such combinations are safe and effective in connection with the treatment, control, or management of obesity in patients having normal thyroid function.
</P>
<P>(b) Combinations of thyroid or other thyrogenic drugs with central nervous system stimulants with or without other drug substances when offered for or as adjuncts to the treatment, control, or management of obesity not related to hypothyroidism are regarded as misbranded. Such combinations when offered for obesity in humans directly attributable to established hypothyroidism are regarded as new drugs within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

<HEAD>§ 250.12   Stramonium preparations labeled with directions for use in self-medication regarded as misbranded.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Stramonium products for inhalation have been offered for use in the therapy of the acute attacks of bronchial asthma for many years although their reliability and effectiveness are questionable. Recently, a significantly increased number of reports have come to the attention of the Food and Drug Administration showing that such products have been subject to abuse and misuse on a fairly large scale, mostly by young people, through oral ingestion for the purpose of producing hallucinations. Reports of such use have been received from physicians and police and other law enforcement authorities. Reports have also appeared in the public press and in medical journals.
</P>
<P>(b) Labeling these products with a warning that they are not for oral ingestion has not been effective in protecting the public. Misuse of stramonium preparations can cause serious toxic effects including toxic delirium, visual disturbances, fever, and coma. A number of serious reactions have already occurred from the oral ingestion of such products.
</P>
<P>(c) On the basis of this information, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that such articles have a potentiality for harmful effect through misuse and are not safe for use except under the supervision of a physician. In the interest of public health protection, therefore, the Food and Drug Administration adopts the following policy:
</P>

<HEAD>§ 250.100   Amyl nitrite inhalant as a prescription drug for human use.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Amyl nitrite inhalant has been available over-the-counter for emergency use by the patient in the management of angina pectoris for a number of years. As a result of a proposed policy statement published August 25, 1967 (32 FR 12404), the Commissioner of Food and Drugs received reports of the abuse of this drug by those who do not require it for medical purposes. Additionally, comment included a great deal of concern expressed by individual physicians, medical associations, pharmaceutical associations, manufacturers, and State and local health authorities. Based on the information available, it is the opinion of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, concurred in by the Food and Drug Administration Medical Advisory Board, that amyl nitrite inhalant is a drug with a potentiality for harmful effect and that it should be removed from over-the-counter status and restricted to sale on the prescription of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug.
</P>
<P>(b) Therefore, amyl nitrite inhalant will be regarded as misbranded unless the labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed bears adequate information for its safe and effective use by physicians, in accordance with § 201.100(c) of this chapter, and its label bears the statement “Rx only.” 
</P>
<P>(c) Regulatory proceedings may be initiated with regard to the interstate shipment of amyl nitrite inhalant that is labeled, advertised, or dispensed contrary to this statement of policy if such act occurs after July 1, 1969.

<P>(a) Recurring reports of abuse and misuse of methamphetamine (also known as desoxyephedrine) inhalers show that they have a potentiality for harmful effect and that they should not be freely available to the public through over-the-counter sale. From complaints by law-enforcement officials, health officials, individual physicians, parents, and others as well as from Food and Drug Administration investigations, it is evident that the wicks from these inhalers are being removed and the methamphetamine they contain is being used as a substitute for amphetamine tablets. Amphetamine tablets and amphetamine inhalers have been restricted to prescription sale because of their potentiality for harm to the user.

<P>(b) It is the considered opinion of the Food and Drug Administration that, in order to adequately protect the public health, inhalers containing methamphetamine or methamphetamine salts (d-desoxyephedrine, or dl-desoxyephedrine, or their salts), as well as amphetamine inhalers should be restricted to prescription sale and should be labeled with the statement “Rx only.”

<P>(b) The Food and Drug Administration also finds that there is neither substantial evidence of effectiveness nor a general recognition by qualified experts that such drugs are effective for any of the other purposes for which some such drugs are promoted to the medical profession in labeling and advertising. In particular, neither clinical investigations nor clinical experience justify any representations that such drugs are effective in the management of hypertension; in the management of coronary insufficiency or coronary artery disease, except for their anginal manifestations; or in the management of the post coronary state, except angina pectoris present after coronary occlusion and myocardial infarction.
</P>
<P>(c) Any preparation containing such drugs that is labeled or advertised for any use other than management of angina pectoris, or that is represented to be efficacious for any other purpose by reason of its containing such drug, will be regarded by the Food and Drug Administration as misbranded and subject to regulatory proceedings, unless such recommendations are covered by the approval of a new-drug application based on a showing of safety and effectiveness.

<HEAD>§ 250.108   Potassium permanganate preparations as prescription drugs.</HEAD>
<P>(a) There have been a number of reports in the medical literature of serious injuries to women resulting from the misuse of potassium permanganate in an effort to induce abortion. Reports from physicians who have treated such cases show that the injuries are commonly caused by introducing tablets or crystals of potassium permanganate into the vagina. Experience with these cases shows that such use of potassium permanganate is not effective in producing abortion, but that instead the drug produces serious and painful injury to the walls of the vagina, causing ulcers, massive hemorrhage, and infection. Such dangerous and useless employment of potassium permanganate is apparently encouraged among the misinformed by the mistaken idea that the vaginal bleeding caused by the corrosive action of the drug indicates a termination of pregnancy, which it does not.
</P>
<P>(b) Potassium permanganate is a strong oxidizing agent, a highly caustic, tissue-destroying chemical, and a poison. There are no circumstances under which crystals and tablets of potassium permanganate constitute safe dosage forms for use in self-medication. It is the consensus of informed medical opinion that the only dosage forms of potassium permanganate known to be safe for use in self-medication are aqueous solutions containing not more than 0.04 percent potassium permanganate. Such solutions are safe for use in self-medication only by external application to the skin.
</P>
<P>(c) In view of the very real potentiality for harmful effect, and the actual injuries caused by the misuse of potassium permanganate, the Food and Drug Administration believes that in order adequately to protect the public health:
</P>
<P>(1) Potassium permanganate and potassium permanganate tablets intended for human use are drugs subject to section 503(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and should be restricted to prescription sale. Such drugs will be regarded as misbranded if at any time prior to dispensing the label fails to bear the statement “Rx only.”
</P>
<P>(2) Potassium permanganate labeled for use as a prescription component in human drugs under the exemption provided in § 201.120 of this chapter or labeled for manufacturing use under the exemption provided in § 201.122 of this chapter will be regarded as misbranded unless the label bears the statement, “Rx only.”
</P>
<P>(3) These drugs will be regarded as misbranded when intended for veterinary use unless the label bears the legend, “Caution: Federal law restricts this drug to sale by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian”; <I>Provided, however,</I> That this shall not apply to a drug labeled and marketed for veterinary use if such drug contains not more than 50 percent of potassium permanganate and includes other ingredients which make it unsuitable for human use and unlikely that the article would be used in an attempt to induce abortion.
</P>
<P>(4) Any preparation of potassium permanganate intended for over-the-counter sale for human use internally or by application to any mucous membranes or for use in the vagina will be regarded as misbranded under the provisions of section 502(f) (1) and (2) and section 502(j) of the act.
</P>
<P>(5) Any other preparation of potassium permanganate intended for over-the-counter sale for human use will be regarded as misbranded under section 502(f) (1) and (2) and section 502(j) of the act unless, among other things, all of the following conditions are met:
</P>
<P>(i) It is an aqueous solution containing not more than 0.04 percent potassium permanganate.
</P>
<P>(ii) The label and labeling bear, in juxtaposition with adequate directions for use, clear warning statements designated as “Warning,” and to the effect: “Warning—For external use on the skin only. Severe injury may result from use internally or as a douche. Avoid contact with mucous membranes.”
</P>
<P>(d) The labeling or dispensing of any potassium permanganate preparations intended for drug use within the jurisdiction of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act contrary to this statement after 60 days from the date of its publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> may be made the subject of regulatory proceedings.

<HEAD>§ 250.201   Preparations for the treatment of pernicious anemia.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The ninth announcement of the Anti-anemia Preparations Advisory Board of the United States Pharmacopeia is concerned with the status of the treatment of pernicious anemia. It clearly presents the following facts:
</P>
<P>(1) The Sixteenth Revision of the Pharmacopeia of the United States, which became official on October 1, 1960, does not include preparations intended for the treatment of pernicious anemia by oral administration.
</P>
<P>(2) The U.S.P. unit for anti-anemia preparations no longer has any significance.
</P>
<P>(3) The U.S.P. Anti-anemia Preparations Advisory Board was disbanded.
</P>
<P>(b) On the basis of the scientific evidence and conclusions summarized in the statement of the U.S.P. Anti-anemia Preparations Advisory Board as well as pertinent information from other sources, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs finds it is the consensus of well informed medical opinion that:
</P>
<P>(1) The parenteral administration of cyanocobalamin or vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> is generally recognized as a fully effective treatment of pernicious anemia. Parenteral cyanocobalamin preparations have not been and are not authorized for use except by or on the prescription of a duly licensed medical practitioner.
</P>
<P>(2) Some patients afflicted with pernicious anemia do not respond to orally ingested products. There is no known way to predict which patients will fail to respond or will cease to respond to the treatment of pernicious anemia with orally ingested preparations.
</P>
<P>(3) The substitution of a possibly inadequate treatment, such as the ingestion of oral preparations of vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> with intrinsic factor concentrate, in place of parenteral vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> products for a disease condition as serious as pernicious anemia cannot be regarded as safe in all cases.
</P>
<P>(4) The development of the classical symptoms of pernicious anemia that would cause a person to seek medical attention may in some cases be delayed by oral ingestion of intrinsic factor. Pernicious anemia is a disease that is associated, among other things, with a higher than normal incidence of cancer of the stomach and that for the safety of the patient, requires continuous expert medical supervision.
</P>
<P>(5) With inadequate treatment there may be markedly deleterious effects on the nervous system. It is well established that whereas the development of anemia is completely reversible with adequate treatment, the involvement of the nervous system may not be completely reversible and thus may result in permanent damage.
</P>
<P>(6) Some hematologists prescribe oral preparations of vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> in the treatment of pernicious-anemia patients.
</P>
<P>(7) Intrinsic factor and intrinsic factor concentrate serve no known useful therapeutic or nutritive purpose except to the extent that they do increase the gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> in patients with a deficiency or absence of intrinsic factor, which may eventually lead to pernicious anemia. This conclusion does not apply to diagnostic procedures using radioactive cyanocobalamin.
</P>
<P>(8) Medical expertise is required for the diagnosis as well as the management of pernicious anemia.
</P>
<P>(c) The Eleventh Edition of The National Formulary and its first Interim Revision include monographs for oral preparations of vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> with intrinsic factor concentrate, establish a unit of vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> with intrinsic factor concentrate, and provide for a National Formulary Anti-anemia Preparations Advisory Board to assign the potency of such preparations. This provides for the availability of such oral preparations, standardized within the meaning of the broad limits characteristic of the evaluation of such preparations.
</P>
<P>(d) Any drug that is offered for or purports to contain intrinsic factor or intrinsic factor concentrate will be regarded as misbranded within the meaning of section 503(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act unless it is labeled with the statement “Rx only.”
</P>
<P>(e) Any drug for oral ingestion intended, represented, or advertised for the prevention or treatment of pernicious anemia or which purports to contain any substance or mixture of substances described in paragraph (d) of this section (other than diagnostic drugs containing radioactive cyanocobalamin) will be regarded as misbranded under sections 502 (f)(2) and (j) of the act unless its labeling bears a statement to the effect that some patients afflicted with pernicious anemia may not respond to the orally ingested product and that there is no known way to predict which patients will respond or which patients may cease to respond to the orally ingested products. The labeling shall also bear a statement that periodic examinations and laboratory studies of pernicious anemia patients are essential and recommended.
</P>
<P>(f) Under section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, intrinsic factor and intrinsic factor concentrate are regarded as food additives. No food additive regulation nor existing extension of the effective date of section 409 of the act authorizes these additives in foods, including foods for special dietary uses. Any food containing added intrinsic factor or intrinsic factor concentrate will be regarded as adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C) of the act.
</P>
<P>(g) Regulatory action may be initiated with respect to any article shipped within the jurisdiction of the act contrary to the provisions of this policy statement after the 180th day following publication of this statement in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

<HEAD>§ 250.250   Hexachlorophene, as a component of drug and cosmetic products.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Antibacterial component.</I> The use of hexachlorophene as an antibacterial component in drug and cosmetic products has expanded widely in recent years. It is used in such products because of its bacteriostatic action against gram-positive organisms, especially against strains of staphylococcus; however, hexachlorophene offers no protection against gram-negative infections. In addition the antibacterial activity depends largely on repeated use. A notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of April 4, 1972 (37 FR 6775), invited data on OTC antimicrobial ingredients, including hexachlorophene, for review by an OTC Drug Advisory Review Panel to be convened under the procedures set forth in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of May 11, 1972 (37 FR 9464). This statement of policy will remain in effect unless and until replaced by a monograph resulting from the OTC Drug Advisory Review Panel.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Adverse effects.</I> Though considered safe for many years, recent information has become available associating hexachlorophene with toxic effects, including deaths. Studies have shown that toxic amounts of hexachlorophene can be absorbed through the skin of humans, especially the skin of premature babies or damaged skin. Human toxicity reports include data on symptomatology, blood and tissue levels of hexachlorophene, and descriptions of neuropathologic lesions. Recent infant deaths due to use of baby powder accidentally contaminated with 6 percent hexachlorophene have occurred. The accumulated evidence of toxicity is sufficient to require that continued marketing of hexachlorophene containing products be carefully defined in order to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Prescription drugs.</I> (1) Because of their potential for harmful effect, drugs containing hexachlorophene, other than as a preservative as described below, are not considered to have been shown to be safe and effective, are regarded as new drugs requiring approved new drug applications, and would be misbranded for over-the-counter distribution. In the interest of public health protection, hexachlorophene containing drugs will be regarded as misbranded and subject to regulatory proceedings unless the label bears the statement “Rx only,” and the labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed bears adequate information for its safe and effective use by practitioners, in accord with § 201.100(c) of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(2) The Food and Drug Administration recognizes that hexachlorophene is useful as a bacteriostatic skin cleanser. It further concludes that the margin of safety is such that products containing hexachlorophene may appropriately be used within clearly delineated conditions of use.
</P>
<P>(3) In order for such drugs to bear adequate information for safe and effective use the following statements are representative of the type of labeling for products shown to be effective bacteriostatic skin cleansers. Labeling for products other than bacteriostatic skin cleansers will be determined through the new drug procedures based on the available data.
</P>
<P>(i) In the labeling other than on the immediate container label.
</P>
<EXTRACT>
<HD1>Indications
</HD1>
<P>1. Bacteriostatic skin cleanser for surgical scrubbing or handwashing as part of patient care.
</P>
<P>2. For topical application to control an outbreak of gram-positive infection where other infection control procedures have been unsuccessful. Use only as long as necessary for infection control.
</P>
<HD1>Contraindications
</HD1>
<P>1. Not for use on burned or denuded skin or on mucous membranes.
</P>
<P>2. Not for routine prophylactic total body bathing.
</P>
<HD1>Warnings
</HD1>
<P>Rinse thoroughly after use. Patients should be closely monitored and use should be immediately discontinued at the first sign of any of the symptoms described below.
</P>
<P>Hexachlorophene is rapidly absorbed and may produce toxic blood levels when applied to skin lesions such as ichthyosis congenita or the dermatitis of Letterer-Siwe's syndrome or other generalized dermatologic conditions. Application to burns has also produced neurotoxicity and death.
</P>
<P>Infants have developed dermatitis, irritability, generalized clonic muscular contractions and decerebrate rigidity following application of a 6 percent hexachlorophene powder. Examination of brainstems of those infants revealed vacuolization like that which can be produced in newborn experimental animals following repeated topical application of 3 percent hexachlorophene. Moreover, a study of histologic sections of premature infants who died of unrelated causes has shown a positive correlation between hexachlorophene baths and lesions in white matter of brains.</P></EXTRACT>
<P>(ii) On the immediate container label prominently displayed and in bold print:
</P>
<EXTRACT>
<P>“Special Warning: This compound may be toxic if used other than as directed. Rinse thoroughly after use. Monitor patients closely for toxicity symptoms.”</P></EXTRACT>
<P>(4) Marketing of products for the indications listed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section may be continued without an approved new drug application (or required supplement thereto) either until a notice of opportunity for hearing is issued on a proposal by the Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to refuse to approve such new drug application (or required supplement) or until January 31, 1978, whichever comes first, if all the following conditions were met after September 27, 1972:
</P>
<P>(i) The product is labeled with the statement “Rx only” and adequate information for safe and effective use as set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) Within 30 days, or by (10-27-72) the holder of an approved new drug application submits a supplement to provide for the revised label and full disclosure labeling. As the label and labeling will have been put into use, the supplement should be submitted under the provision of § 314.70(c)(6)(iii) of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(iii) Within 30 days, or by (10-27-72) the holder of an approved new drug application submits a supplement to provide for a revised formulation where appropriate to comply with this order.
</P>
<P>(iv) Within 90 days, or by (12-26-72) the holder of an approved new drug application submits a supplement containing blood level data obtained from use of the drug as recommended, unless such information is a part of the new drug application file.
</P>
<P>(v) Within 90 days, or by (12-26-72), the manufacturer or distributor of such a drug for which a new drug approval is not in effect submits a new drug application in accord with § 314.50 of the new drug regulations (21 CFR 314.50), including blood level data obtained from use of the drug as recommended.
</P>
<P>(5) Prescription drug products may contain hexachlorophene as part of an effective preservative system only under the conditions and limitations provided for under paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs.</I> Over-the-counter drug products, other than those which in normal use may be applied to mucous membranes or which are intended to be used on mucous membranes, may contain hexachlorophene only as part of an effective preservative system, at a level that is no higher than necessary to achieve the intended preservative function, and in no event higher than 0.1 percent. Such use of hexachlorophene shall be limited to situations where an alternative preservative has not yet been shown to be as effective or where adequate integrity and stability data for the reformulated product are not yet available. This use of hexachlorophene will not, by itself, require an approved new drug application. Use of hexachlorophene as a preservative at a level higher than 0.1 percent is regarded as a new drug use requiring an approved new drug application, which must be submitted within the time set out in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Cosmetics.</I> Hexachlorophene may be used as a preservative in cosmetic products other than those which in normal use may be applied to mucous membranes or which are intended to be used on mucous membranes, at a level that is no higher than necessary to achieve the intended preservative function, and in no event higher than 0.1 percent. Such use of hexachlorophene shall be limited to situations where an alternative preservative has not yet been shown to be as effective or where adequate integrity and stability data for the reformulated product are not yet available. The component of a preservative system whether hexachlorophene or other antimicrobial agent, should be selected on the basis of the effect on the total microbial ecology of the product, not merely on gram-positive bacteria.
</P>
<P>(1) Adequate safety data do not presently exist to justify wider use of hexachlorophene in cosmetics.
</P>
<P>(2) Antibacterial ingredients used as substitutes for hexachlorophene in cosmetic products, and finished cosmetic products containing such ingredients, shall be adequately tested for safety prior to marketing. Any such ingredient or product whose safety is not adequately substantiated prior to marketing may be adulterated and will in any event be deemed misbranded unless it contains a conspicuous front panel statement that the product has not been adequately tested for safety and may be hazardous.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Content statement.</I> All reference to hexachlorophene limit in this order is on a weight-in-weight (w/w) basis. Quantitative declaration of hexachlorophene content on the labeling of the products, where required, shall be on a w/w basis.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Shipments of products.</I> Shipments of products falling within the scope of paragraphs (c), (d), or (e) of this section which are not in compliance with the guidelines stated herein shall be the subject of regulatory proceedings after the effective date of the final order.

After an initial 2-year period beginning on the date of the first import entry under any SIP authorized under this part, the Secretary may determine, based on experience under the program, that there is a sufficient likelihood that a proposal that does not include a State or Indian Tribe as the SIP sponsor could provide the same level of assurance of safety as a proposal that does include such a sponsor, such that FDA may begin receiving, reviewing, and potentially authorizing applications for SIPs without such a sponsor. After the Secretary makes such a determination, a pharmacist or wholesaler may propose a SIP that does not include a State or Indian Tribe as a sponsor, and FDA may authorize such a SIP if the sponsor demonstrates that the SIP meets the criteria for authorization with the same level of assurance of safety as a proposal that includes a State or Indian Tribe as the SIP sponsor, which FDA shall evaluate consistent with any considerations described in the Secretary's determination, including by evaluating whether the application demonstrates that the proposed sponsor has sufficient relevant experience, such as participating in a SIP and demonstrating compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and this part.
</P>
<P><I>Section 804 Importation Program Co-Sponsor (“SIP Co-Sponsor”)</I> means any other State or Indian Tribe, or a pharmacist or a wholesale distributor that, with the SIP Sponsor, signs a proposal to FDA that describes a program to facilitate the importation of prescription drugs from Canada under section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

For purposes of the SSI, “package” means the smallest individual saleable unit of product for distribution that is intended by the Foreign Seller for sale to an Importer located in the United States, and “individual saleable unit” means the smallest container of product sold by the Foreign Seller to the Importer.
</P>
<P><I>Serious adverse event</I> means:
</P>
<P>(1) An adverse event is considered “serious” if it results in any of the following outcomes:
</P>
<P>(i) Death;
</P>
<P>(ii) A life-threatening adverse event;
</P>
<P>(iii) Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
</P>

</P>
<P>(v) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.
</P>
<P>(2) Other events that may be considered serious adverse events: Important medical events that may not result in one of the listed outcomes in this definition may be considered serious adverse events when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or study subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples include: Allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of product dependency or product abuse.
</P>
<P><I>Statutory Testing</I> means the testing of an eligible prescription drug as required by section 804(d)(1)(J) and (L) and section 804(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including for authenticity, for degradation, and to ensure that the prescription drug is in compliance with established specifications and standards.
</P>
<P><I>Suspect foreign product</I> means a drug purchased by a Foreign Seller from a manufacturer, and intended for sale to an Importer in the United States, for which the Foreign Seller has reason to believe that such product:
</P>
<P>(1) Is potentially counterfeit, diverted, or stolen;
</P>
<P>(2) Is potentially intentionally adulterated such that the product would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans;
</P>
<P>(3) Is potentially the subject of a fraudulent transaction; or
</P>
<P>(4) Appears otherwise unfit for distribution such that the product would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans.
</P>
<P><I>Transaction</I> means the transfer of product between persons in which a change of ownership occurs, in accordance with section 581(24) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. For the purposes of this part, “transaction” includes the sale and transfer of product between the manufacturer and Foreign Seller. The sale and transfer of product between Foreign Seller and Importer also constitutes a “transaction.”
</P>
<P><I>Unexpected adverse event</I> means an adverse event that is not included in the current U.S. labeling for the drug product. Events that may be symptomatically or pathophysiologically related to an adverse event included in the labeling but differ from the labeled event because of greater severity or specificity would be considered unexpected. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events that are mentioned in the product labeling as occurring with a class of products or anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the product but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Example of greater severity.</I> Under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the labeling referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Example of greater specificity.</I> Cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral hemorrhage would be unexpected if the labeling included only cerebrovascular accidents.
</P>
<P><I>Unique facility identifier</I> means the identifier required to be submitted by the registrant for drug establishment registration under section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in accordance with § 207.25 of this chapter. For Foreign Sellers registering under section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the term “unique facility identifier” means the identifier required to be submitted under § 251.9 in accordance with the system specified under section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P><I>Wholesaler</I> means a person licensed as a wholesale distributor, as the terms “licensed” and “wholesale distributor” are defined in section 581(9)(A) and 581(29), respectively. The term “wholesaler” does not include a person authorized to import drugs under section 801(d)(1).

<DIV8 N="251.4" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="4">
<HEAD>§ 251.4   Review and authorization of importation program proposals.</HEAD>
<P>Based on a review of a SIP Proposal or supplemental proposal submitted under this part, FDA may authorize a SIP, modify a SIP, or extend the authorization period of a SIP, that meets the requirements of this part. FDA may use a phased review process to review a SIP Proposal that does not identify a Foreign Seller in an initial submission, under which FDA may notify the Sponsor of such a SIP Proposal whether the Sponsor's SIP Proposal otherwise meets the requirements of this part. In such a case, the required information regarding importers, relabelers, and repackagers still must be included in the initial submission of the SIP Proposal, and the SIP Proposal will be denied if a Foreign Seller is not identified within 6 months of the initial submission date of the SIP Proposal.
</P>
<P>(a) FDA may deny a request for authorization, modification, or extension of a SIP, including if a SIP Proposal or supplemental proposal does not meet the requirements of this part. When a SIP Proposal or supplemental proposal meets the requirements of this part, FDA may nonetheless decide not to authorize the SIP Proposal or supplemental proposal. For example, FDA may decide not to authorize a SIP Proposal or supplemental proposal because of potential safety concerns with the SIP; because a Foreign Seller is not identified within 6 months of the initial submission of the SIP Proposal; because of the degree of uncertainty that the SIP Proposal or supplemental proposal would adequately ensure the protection of public health; because of, based on the recommendation of another Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) component as directed by the Secretary, the relative likelihood that the SIP Proposal or supplemental proposal would not result in significant cost savings to the American consumer; because of the potential for conflicts of interest; or in order to limit the number of authorized SIPs so FDA can effectively and efficiently carry out its responsibilities under section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in light of the amount of resources allocated to carrying out such responsibilities.
</P>
<P>(b) FDA will notify a SIP Sponsor in writing when FDA receives the SIP Sponsor's SIP Proposal or supplemental proposal.
</P>
<P>(c) FDA will make a reasonable effort to promptly communicate to a SIP Sponsor about any information required by § 251.3 that was not submitted in a SIP Proposal.
</P>
<P>(1) FDA may notify a SIP Sponsor if FDA believes additional information would help FDA's review of a SIP Proposal or supplemental proposal.
</P>
<P>(2) FDA will notify a SIP Sponsor in writing whether FDA has decided to authorize or not to authorize the SIP Sponsor's SIP Proposal or supplemental proposal.

<P>(a) As used in this part 299, <I>act</I> means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, sections 201-902, 52 Stat. 1040 (21 U.S.C. 321-392), with all amendments thereto.
</P>
<P>(b) The definitions and interpretations contained in section 201 of the act shall be applicable to such terms when used in this part 299.

<P>(c) The term <I>official name</I> means, with respect to a drug or ingredient thereof, the name designated in this part 299 under section 508 of the act as the official name.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="299.4" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="4">
<HEAD>§ 299.4   Established names for drugs.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Section 508 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (added by the Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments of 1962; Pub. L. 87-781) authorizes the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to designate an official name for any drug if he determines that such action is necessary or desirable in the interest of usefulness and simplicity. Section 502(e) of the act (as amended by said Drug Amendments) prescribes that the labeling of a drug must bear its established name, if there is one, to the exclusion of any other nonproprietary name (except the applicable systematic chemical name or the chemical formula) and, if the drug is fabricated from two or more ingredients, the established name of each active ingredient.
</P>
<P>(b) The term <I>established name</I> is defined in section 502(e)(3) of the act as (1) an official name designated pursuant to section 508 of the act; (2) if no such official name has been designated for the drug and the drug is an article recognized in an official compendium, then the official title thereof in such compendium; and (3) if neither paragraphs (b) (1) or (2) of this section applies, then the common or usual name of the drug.
</P>
<P>(c) The Food and Drug Administration recognizes the skill and experience of the U.S. Adopted Names Council (USAN) in deriving names for drugs. The U.S. Adopted Names Council is a private organization sponsored by the American Medical Association, the United States Pharmacopeia, and the American Pharmaceutical Association, and has been engaged in the assignment of names to drugs since January 1964. The Council negotiates with manufacturing firms in the selection of nonproprietary names for drugs.
</P>
<P>(d) The Food and Drug Administration cooperates with and is represented on the USAN Council. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration agrees with “Guiding Principles for Coining U.S. Adopted Names for Drugs,” published in <I>USAN and the USP Dictionary of Drug Names</I> (USAN 1985 ed., 1961-1984 cumulative list), which is incorporated by reference. Copies are available from: U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., 12601 Twinbrook Parkway, Rockville, MD 20852, or are available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <I>http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.</I> All applicants for new-drug applications and sponsors for “Investigational New Drug Applications” (IND's) are encouraged to contact the USAN Council for assistance in selection of a simple and useful name for a new chemical entity. Approval of a new-drug application providing for the use of a new drug substance may be delayed if a simple and useful nonproprietary name does not exist for the substance and if one is not proposed in the application that meets the above-cited guidelines. Prior use of a name in the medical literature or otherwise will not commit the Food and Drug Administration to adopting such terminology as official.
</P>
<P>(e) The Food and Drug Administration will not routinely designate official names under section 508 of the act. As a result, the established name under section 502(e) of the act will ordinarily be either the compendial name of the drug or, if there is no compendial name, the common and usual name of the drug. Interested persons, in the absence of the designation by the food and Drug Administration of an official name, may rely on as the established name for any drug the current compendial name or the USAN adopted name listed in <I>USAN and the USP Dictionary of Drug Names.</I> The Food and Drug Administration, however, will continue to publish official names under the provisions of section 508 of the act when the agency determines that:
</P>
<P>(1) The USAN or other official or common or usual name is unduly complex or is not useful for any other reason;
</P>
<P>(2) Two or more official names have been applied to a single drug, or to two or more drugs that are identical in chemical structure and pharmacological action and that are substantially identical in strength, quality, and purity; or
</P>
<P>(3) No USAN or other official or common or usual name has been applied to a medically useful drug. Any official name published under section 508 of the act will be the established name of the drug.
</P>
<P>(f) A cumulative list of U.S. adopted names selected and released since June 15, 1961, is published yearly by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., in <I>USAN and the USP Dictionary of Drug Names.</I> Copies may be purchased from the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., 12601 Twinbrook Parkway, Rockville, MD 20852.

<P>The Food and Drug Administration's policy in administering the new-drug, antibiotic, and other regulatory provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding fixed combination dosage form prescription drugs for humans is as follows: 
</P>
<P>(a) Two or more drugs may be combined in a single dosage form when each component makes a contribution to the claimed effects and the dosage of each component (amount, frequency, duration) is such that the combination is safe and effective for a significant patient population requiring such concurrent therapy as defined in the labeling for the drug. Special cases of this general rule are where a component is added: 
</P>
<P>(1) To enhance the safety or effectiveness of the principal active component; and
</P>
<P>(2) To minimize the potential for abuse of the principal active component.
</P>
<P>(b) If a combination drug presently the subject of an approved new-drug application has not been recognized as effective by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs based on his evaluation of the appropriate National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council panel report, or if substantial evidence of effectiveness has not otherwise been presented for it, then formulation, labeling, or dosage changes may be proposed and any resulting formulation may meet the appropriate criteria listed in paragraph (a) of this section. 
</P>

<HEAD>§ 310.6   Applicability of “new drug” or safety or effectiveness findings in drug efficacy study implementation notices and notices of opportunity for hearing to identical, related, and similar drug products.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Food and Drug Administration's conclusions on the effectiveness of drugs are currently being published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) Notices and as Notices of Opportunity for Hearing. The specific products listed in these notices include only those that were introduced into the market through the new drug procedures from 1938-62 and were submitted for review by the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group. Many products which are identical to, related to, or similar to the products listed in these notices have been marketed under different names or by different firms during this same period or since 1962 without going through the new drug procedures or the Academy review. Even though these products are not listed in the notices, they are covered by the new drug applications reviewed and thus are subject to these notices. All persons with an interest in a product that is identical, related, or similar to a drug listed in a drug efficacy notice or a notice of opportunity for a hearing will be given the same opportunity as the applicant to submit data and information, to request a hearing, and to participate in any hearing. It is not feasible for the Food and Drug Administration to list all products which are covered by an NDA and thus subject to each notice. However, it is essential that the findings and conclusions that a drug product is a “new drug” or that there is a lack of evidence to show that a drug product is safe or effective be applied to all identical, related, and similar drug products to which they are reasonably applicable. Any product not in compliance with an applicable drug efficacy notice is in violation of section 505 (new drugs) and/or section 502 (misbranding) of the act. 
</P>
<P>(b)(1) An identical, related, or similar drug includes other brands, potencies, dosage forms, salts, and esters of the same drug moiety as well as of any drug moiety related in chemical structure or known pharmacological properties.
</P>
<P>(2) Where experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs would conclude that the findings and conclusions, stated in a drug efficacy notice or notice of opportunity for hearing, that a drug product is a “new drug” or that there is a lack of evidence to show that a drug product is safe or effective are applicable to an identical, related, or similar drug product, such product is affected by the notice. A combination drug product containing a drug that is identical, related, or similar to a drug named in a notice may also be subject to the findings and conclusions in a notice that a drug product is a “new drug” or that there is a lack of evidence to show that a drug product is safe or effective.
</P>
<P>(3) Any person may request an opinion on the applicability of such a notice to a specific product by writing to the Food and Drug Administration at the address shown in paragraph (e) of this section.
</P>
<P>(c) Manufacturers and distributors of drugs should review their products as drug efficacy notices are published and assure that identical, related, or similar products comply with all applicable provisions of the notices.
</P>
<P>(d) The published notices and summary lists of the conclusions are of particular interest to drug purchasing agents. These agents should take particular care to assure that the same purchasing policy applies to drug products that are identical, related, or similar to those named in the drug efficacy notices. The Food and Drug Administration applies the same regulatory policy to all such products. In many instances a determination can readily be made as to the applicability of a drug efficacy notice by an individual who is knowledgeable about drugs and their indications for use. Where the relationships are more subtle and not readily recognized, the purchasing agent may request an opinion by writing to the Food and Drug Administration at the address shown in paragraph (e) of this section. 
</P>
<P>(e) Interested parties may submit to the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Office of Compliance, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002, the names of drug products, and of their manufacturers or distributors, that should be the subject of the same purchasing and regulatory policies as those reviewed by the Drug Efficacy Study Group. Appropriate action, including referral to purchasing officials of various government agencies, will be taken. 
</P>
<P>(f) This regulation does not apply to OTC drugs identical, similar, or related to a drug in the Drug Efficacy Study unless there has been or is notification in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that a drug will not be subject to an OTC panel review pursuant to §§ 330.10, 330.11, and 330.5 of this chapter.

<DIV8 N="310.100" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="5">
<HEAD>§ 310.100   New drug status opinions; statement of policy.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Over the years since 1938 the Food and Drug Administration has given informal advice to inquirers as to the new drug status of preparations. These drugs have sometimes been identified only by general statements of composition. Generally, such informal opinions were incorporated in letters that did not explicitly relate all of the necessary conditions and qualifications such as the quantitative formula for the drug and the conditions under which it was prescribed, recommended, or suggested. This has contributed to misunderstanding and misinterpretation of such opinions. 
</P>
<P>(b) These informal opinions that an article is “not a new drug” or “no longer a new drug” require reexamination under the Kefauver-Harris Act (Public Law 87-781; 76 Stat. 788-89). In particular, when approval of a new drug application is withdrawn under provisions of section 505(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a drug generally recognized as safe may become a “new drug” within the meaning of section 201(p) of said act as amended by the Kefauver-Harris Act on October 10, 1962. This is of special importance by reason of proposed actions to withdraw approval of new drug applications for lack of substantial evidence of effectiveness as a result of reports of the National Academy of Sciences—National Research Council on its review of drug effectiveness; for example, see the notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of January 23, 1968 (33 FR 818), regarding rutin, quercetin, et al. 
</P>
<P>(c) Any marketed drug is a “new drug” if any labeling change made after October 9, 1962, recommends or suggests new conditions of use under which the drug is not generally recognized as safe and effective by qualified experts. Undisclosed or unreported side effects as well as the emergence of new knowledge presenting questions with respect to the safety or effectiveness of a drug may result in its becoming a “new drug” even though it was previously considered “not a new drug.” Any previously given informal advice that an article is “not a new drug” does not apply to such an article if it has been changed in formulation, manufacture control, or labeling in a way that may significantly affect the safety of the drug. 
</P>
<P>(d) For these reasons, all opinions previously given by the Food and Drug Administration to the effect that an article is “not a new drug” or is “no longer a new drug” are hereby revoked. This does not mean that all articles that were the subjects of such prior opinions will be regarded as new drugs. The prior opinions will be replaced by opinions of the Food and Drug Administration that are qualified and current on when an article is “not a new drug,” as set forth in this subchapter.

<P>(a) The Food and Drug Administration is aware of the need in the practice of medicine for the ingredients of a new drug to be available for tests of hypersensitivity to such ingredients and therefore will not object to the shipment of a new drug substance, as defined in § 310.3(g), for such purpose if all of the following conditions are met: 
</P>
<P>(1) The shipment is made as a result of a specific request made to the manufacturer or distributor by a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs, and the use of such drugs for patch testing is not promoted by the manufacturer or distributor. 
</P>
<P>(2) The new drug substance requested is an ingredient in a marketed new drug and is not one that is an ingredient solely in a new drug that is legally available only under the investigational drug provisions of this part. 
</P>
<P>(3) The label bears the following prominently placed statements in lieu of adequate directions for use and in addition to complying with the other labeling provisions of the act: 
</P>
<P>(i) “Rx only”; and 
</P>
<P>(ii) “For use only in patch testing”. 
</P>
<P>(4) The quantity shipped is limited to an amount reasonable for the purpose of patch testing in the normal course of the practice of medicine and is used solely for such patch testing. 
</P>
<P>(5) The new drug substance is manufactured by the same procedures and meets the same specifications as the component used in the finished dosage form. 
</P>
<P>(6) The manufacturer or distributor maintains records of all shipments for this purpose for a period of 2 years after shipment and will make them available to the Food and Drug Administration on request. 
</P>
<P>(b) When the requested new drug substance is intended for investigational use in humans or the substance is legally available only under the investigational drug provisions of part 312 of this chapter, the submission of an “Investigational New Drug Application” (IND) is required. The Food and Drug Administration will offer assistance to any practitioner wishing to submit an Investigational New Drug Application.

<DIV8 N="310.305" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="5">
<HEAD>§ 310.305   Records and reports concerning adverse drug experiences on marketed prescription drugs for human use without approved new drug applications.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Scope.</I> FDA is requiring manufacturers, packers, and distributors of marketed prescription drug products that are not the subject of an approved new drug or abbreviated new drug application to establish and maintain records and make reports to FDA of all serious, unexpected adverse drug experiences associated with the use of their drug products. Any person subject to the reporting requirements of paragraph (c) of this section must also develop written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of postmarketing adverse drug experiences to FDA.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Definitions.</I> The following definitions of terms apply to this section:
</P>
<P><I>Adverse drug experience.</I> Any adverse event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, including the following: An adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in professional practice; an adverse event occurring from drug overdose whether accidental or intentional; an adverse event occurring from drug abuse; an adverse event occurring from drug withdrawal; and any failure of expected pharmacological action.
</P>
<P><I>Disability.</I> A substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions.
</P>
<P><I>Individual case safety report (ICSR).</I> A description of an adverse drug experience related to an individual patient or subject.
</P>
<P><I>ICSR attachments.</I> Documents related to the adverse drug experience described in an ICSR, such as medical records, hospital discharge summaries, or other documentation.
</P>
<P><I>Life-threatening adverse drug experience.</I> Any adverse drug experience that places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at <I>immediate</I> risk of death from the adverse drug experience as it occurred, <I>i.e.</I>, it does not include an adverse drug experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
</P>
<P><I>Serious adverse drug experience.</I> Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
</P>
<P><I>Unexpected adverse drug experience.</I> Any adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product. This includes events that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling, but differ from the event because of greater severity or specificity. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the labeling only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously observed (<I>i.e.</I>, included in the labeling) rather than from the perspective of such experience not being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical product.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Reporting requirements.</I> Each person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section must submit to FDA adverse drug experience information as described in this section. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, 15-day “Alert reports” and followup reports, including ICSRs and any ICSR attachments, must be submitted to the Agency in electronic format as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Postmarketing 15-day “Alert reports”.</I> (i) Any person whose name appears on the label of a marketed prescription drug product as its manufacturer, packer, or distributor must report to FDA each adverse drug experience received or otherwise obtained that is both serious and unexpected as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days from initial receipt of the information by the person whose name appears on the label. Each report must be accompanied by the current content of labeling in electronic format as an ICSR attachment unless it is already on file at FDA.
</P>
<P>(ii) A person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is not required to submit a 15-day “Alert report” for an adverse drug experience obtained from a postmarketing study (whether or not conducted under an investigational new drug application) unless the applicant concludes that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse experience.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Postmarketing 15-day “Alert reports”—followup.</I> Each person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section must promptly investigate all serious, unexpected adverse drug experiences that are the subject of these postmarketing 15-day Alert reports and must submit followup reports within 15 calendar days of receipt of new information or as requested by FDA. If additional information is not obtainable, records should be maintained of the unsuccessful steps taken to seek additional information. 
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Submission of reports.</I> To avoid unnecessary duplication in the submission of, and followup to, reports required in this section, a packer's or distributor's obligations may be met by submission of all reports of serious adverse drug experiences to the manufacturer of the drug product. If a packer or distributor elects to submit these adverse drug experience reports to the manufacturer rather than to FDA, it must submit, by any appropriate means, each report to the manufacturer within 5 calendar days of its receipt by the packer or distributor, and the manufacturer must then comply with the requirements of this section even if its name does not appear on the label of the drug product. Under this circumstance, the packer or distributor must maintain a record of this action which must include:
</P>
<P>(i) A copy of each adverse drug experience report;
</P>
<P>(ii) The date the report was received by the packer or distributor;
</P>
<P>(iii) The date the report was submitted to the manufacturer; and
</P>
<P>(iv) The name and address of the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>(4) [Reserved]
</P>
<P>(5) A person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is not required to resubmit to FDA adverse drug experience reports forwarded to that person by FDA; however, the person must submit all <I>followup</I> information on such reports to FDA.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Information reported on ICSRs.</I> ICSRs include the following information:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Patient information.</I>
</P>
<P>(i) Patient identification code;
</P>

These waivers will be granted on a limited basis for good cause shown. FDA will issue guidance on requesting a waiver of the requirements in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Patient privacy.</I> Manufacturers, packers, and distributors should not include in reports under this section the names and addresses of individual patients; instead, the manufacturer, packer, and distributor should assign a unique code for identification of the patient. The manufacturer, packer, and distributor should include the name of the reporter from whom the information was received as part of the initial reporter information, even when the reporter is the patient. The names of patients, individual reporters, health care professionals, hospitals, and geographical identifiers in adverse drug experience reports are not releasable to the public under FDA's public information regulations in part 20 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Recordkeeping.</I> (1) Each manufacturer, packer, and distributor must maintain for a period of 10 years records of all adverse drug experiences required under this section to be reported, including raw data and any correspondence relating to the adverse drug experiences, and the records required to be maintained under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

</P>
<P>(h) <I>Disclaimer.</I> A report or information submitted by a manufacturer, packer, or distributor under this section (and any release by FDA of that report or information) does not necessarily reflect a conclusion by the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, or by FDA, that the report or information constitutes an admission that the drug caused or contributed to an adverse effect. The manufacturer, packer, or distributor need not admit, and may deny, that the report or information submitted under this section constitutes an admission that the drug caused or contributed to an adverse effect.

<HEAD>§ 310.503   Requirements regarding certain radioactive drugs.</HEAD>
<P>(a) On January 8, 1963 (28 FR 183), the Commissioner of Food and Drugs exempted investigational radioactive new drugs from part 312 of this chapter provided they were shipped in complete conformity with the regulations issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This exemption also applied to investigational radioactive biologics. 
</P>
<P>(b) It is the opinion of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Food and Drug Administration that this exemption should not apply for certain specific drugs and that these drugs should be appropriately labeled for uses for which safety and effectiveness can be demonstrated by new drug applications or through licensing under the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262 <I>et seq.</I>) in the case of biologics. Continued distribution under the investigational exemption when the drugs are intended for established uses will not be permitted. 
</P>
<P>(c) Based on its experience in regulating investigational radioactive pharmaceuticals, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has compiled a list of reactor-produced isotopes for which it considers that applicants may reasonably be expected to submit adequate evidence of safety and effectiveness for use as recommended in appropriate labeling. Such use may include, among others, the uses in this tabulation:

<HEAD>§ 310.517   Labeling for oral hypoglycemic drugs of the sulfonylurea class.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The University Group Diabetes Program clinical trial has reported an association between the administration of tolbutamide and increased cardiovascular mortality. The Food and Drug Administration has concluded that this reported association provides adequate basis for a warning in the labeling. In view of the similarities in chemical structure and mode of action, the Food and Drug Administration also believes it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that the possible increased risk of cardiovascular mortality from tolbutamide applies to all other sulfonylurea drugs as well. Therefore, the labeling for oral hypoglycemic drugs of the sulfonylurea class shall include a warning concerning the possible increased risk of cardiovascular mortality associated with such use, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
</P>
<P>(b) Labeling for oral hypoglycemic drugs of the sulfonylurea class shall include in boldface type at the beginning of the “Warnings” section of the labeling the following statement:

<EXTRACT>
<HD1>Special Warning on Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality
</HD1>
<P>The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (<I>Diabetes,</I> 19 (supp. 2): 747-830, 1970).
</P>
<P>UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2
<FR>1/2</FR> times that of patients treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of (name of drug) and of alternative modes of therapy.
</P>
<P>Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure.</P></EXTRACT>

<P>(a) The term “hormone” is used broadly to describe a chemical substance formed in some organ of the body, such as the adrenal glands or the pituitary, and carried to another organ or tissue, where it has a specific effect. Hormones include, for example, estrogens, progestins, androgens, anabolic steroids, and adrenal corticosteroids, and synthetic analogs. Estrogens, progesterone, pregnenolone, and pregnenolone acetate have been present as ingredients in OTC drug products marketed for topical use as hormone creams. However, there is a lack of adequate data to establish effectiveness for any OTC drug use of these ingredients. Therefore, with the exception of those hormones identified in paragraph (e) of this section, any OTC drug product containing an ingredient offered for use as a topically applied hormone cannot be considered generally recognized as safe and effective for its intended use. The intended use of the product may be inferred from the product's labeling, promotional material, advertising, and any other relevant factor. The use of the word “hormone” in the text of the labeling or in the ingredient statement is an implied drug claim. The claim implied by the use of this term is that the product will have a therapeutic or some other physiological effect on the body. Therefore, reference to a product as a “hormone cream” or any statement in the labeling indicating that “hormones” are present in the product, or any statement that features or emphasizes the presence of a hormone ingredient in the product, will be considered to be a therapeutic claim for the product, or a claim that the product will affect the structure or function of the body, and will consequently cause the product to be a drug.

<P>(a) Hemicellulase, pancreatin, and pancrelipase have been present as ingredients in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency drug products. Pancreatin and pancrelipase are composed of enzymes: amylase, trypsin (protease), and lipase. Significant differences have been shown in the bioavailability of marketed exocrine pancreatic insufficiency drug products produced by different manufacturers. These differences raise a potential for serious risk to patients using these drug products. The bioavailability of pancreatic enzymes is dependent on the process used to manufacture the drug products. Information on this process is not included in an OTC drug monograph. Therefore, the safe and effective use of these enzymes for treating exocrine pancreatic insufficiency cannot be regulated adequately by an OTC drug monograph. Information on the product's formulation, manufacture, quality control procedures, and final formulation effectiveness testing are necessary in an approved application to ensure that a company has the ability to manufacture a proper bioactive formulation. In addition, continuous physician monitoring of patients who take these drug products is a collateral measure necessary to the safe and effective use of these enzymes, causing such products to be available by prescription only.

</P>
<P>(d) <I>Conditions of use</I>—(1) <I>Beef cattle and nonlactating dairy cattle</I>—(i) <I>Amount.</I> It is used at the rate of one-half fluid ounce per 100 pounds of body weight applied topically on the backline of the animal. Only one application per season should be made for grub control and this will also provide initial control of lice. A second application for lice control may be made if animals become reinfested, but no sooner than 35 days after the first treatment. Proper timing of treatment is important for grub control; cattle should be treated as soon as possible after heel-fly activity ceases.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Indications for use.</I> For the control of grubs and lice in beef and nonlactating cattle.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Limitations.</I> Do not use on animals simultaneously or within a few days before or after treatment with or exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting drugs, pesticides, or chemicals. Cattle should not be slaughtered within 35 days following a single treatment. If a second application is made for lice control, cattle should not be slaughtered within 45 days of the second treatment. The drug must not be used within 28 days of freshening of dairy cattle. If freshening should occur within 28 days after treatment, do not use milk as human food for the balance of the 28-day interval. Do not treat lactating dairy cattle; calves less than 3 months old; or sick, convalescent, or stressed livestock. Do not treat cattle for 10 days before or after shipping, weaning, or dehorning or after exposure to contagious infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Beef cattle and dairy cattle not of breeding age</I>—(i) <I>Amount.</I> It is administered as a single, topical application placed on the backline of animals as follows: For animals weighing 150 to 300 pounds, apply 4 milliliters (mL); for animals weighing 301 to 600 pounds, apply 8 mL; for animals weighing 601 to 900 pounds, apply 12 mL; for animals weighing 901 to 1,200 pounds, apply 16 mL; and for animal weighing over 1,200 pounds, apply 20 mL. For most effective results, cattle should be treated as soon as possible after heel-fly activity ceases. A second application is required for animals heavily infested with lice or for those which become reinfested. A second application should be made no sooner than 35 days after the first treatment.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Indications for use.</I> For control of cattle grubs and as an aid in controlling lice on beef cattle and on dairy cattle not of breeding age.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Limitations.</I> Do not use on animals simultaneously or within a few days before or after treatment with or exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting drugs, pesticides, or chemicals. Host-parasite reactions such as bloat, salivation, staggering and paralysis may sometimes occur when cattle are treated while the common cattle grub (<I>Hypoderma lineatum</I>) is in the gullet, or while the northern cattle grub (<I>H. bovis</I>) is in the area of the spinal cord. Cattle should be treated before these stages of grub development. Consult your veterinarian, extension livestock specialist, or extension entomologist regarding the timing of treatment. If it is impossible to determine the area from which the cattle came and/or exact stage of the grubs, it is recommended that the cattle receive only a maintenance ration of low-energy feed during the treatment period. This lessens the likelihood of severe bloat which may occur in cattle on full feed when the common grub is killed while in the gullet. Do not treat dairy cattle of breeding age; calves less than 3 months old; sick, convalescent, or severely stressed livestock. Do not treat cattle for 10 days before or after shipping, weaning, dehorning, or after exposure to contagious or infectious diseases. Do not slaughter within 45 days of treatment.

<P>(i) <I>Dip vat procedure.</I> (A) Prior to charging vat, empty old contents and thoroughly clean the vat. Dip vats should be calibrated to maintain an accurate dilution. Add water, then drug to the vat according to the dilution rate indicated in the table. Add super phosphate at a rate of 100 pounds per 1,000 gallons of vat solution. Super phosphate is added to control the pH of the solution and ensure vat stability. Super phosphate is usually available at most fertilizer dealers as 0-45-0 or 0-46-0. Stir the dip thoroughly, preferably with a compressed air device; however, any form of thorough mixing is adequate. Re-stir vat contents prior to each use. During the dipping operation, each time the dip's volume is reduced by 
<FR>1/8</FR> to 
<FR>1/4</FR> of its initial volume, replenish with water and add the drug at a rate of 1 gallon for each 50 or 200 gallons water added—depending on dilution rate 1:60 or 1:240. Also add super phosphate as necessary to maintain pH between 4.5 and 6.5. Stir well and resume dipping. Repeat replenishment process as necessary. For evaportion, add additional water accordingly. For added water due to rainfall, merely replenish dip with the product according to directions. If overflow occurs, either analyze for drug concentration and adjust accordingly or dispose of vat contents and recharge. Check pH after each addition of water or super phosphate to assure proper pH controls.
</P>
<P>(B) <I>Dip maintenance.</I> (<I>1</I>) With use of dip vat tester, dipping may continue as long as the drug concentration is maintained between 0.15 and 0.25 percent, and the dip is not too foul for satisfactory use as indicated by foul odor or excessive darkening (i.e., color changes from beige to very dark brown).
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) Without use of dip vat tester, vat should be emptied, cleaned, and recharged each time one of the following occurs: When the dip has been charged for 120 days; when the dip becomes too foul for satisfactory use, within the 120-day limit; if the number of animals dipped equals twice the number of gallons of the initial dip volume, within the 120-day limit.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Spray method.</I> To prepare the spray, mix drug with water according to table and stir thoroughly. Apply the fresh mixture as a high-pressure spray, taking care to wet the skin, not just the hair. Apply to the point of “runoff,” about 1 gallon of diluted spray per adult animal. Lesser amounts will permit runoff for younger animals.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Pour-on method.</I> Dilute the drug with water according to table by slowly adding water to the product while stirring. Apply 1 ounce of the diluted mixture per 100 pounds of body weight (to a maximum of 8 ounces per head) down the center line of the back.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Timing of applications for cattle grub control.</I> For optimum cattle grub control, it is important to treat as soon as possible after the heel fly season, before the grub larvae reach the gullet or spinal canal, as the rapid kill of large numbers of larvae in these tissues may cause toxic side effects, such as bloat, salivation, staggering, and paralysis.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Treatment regimens.</I> (i) Control of scabies mites requires two treatments, 10 to 14 days apart.
</P>
<P>(ii) Control of Lone Star Ticks and hornflies requires two treatments, 7 days apart.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Warnings.</I> The drug is a cholinesterase inhibitor. Do not use this drug on animals simultaneously or within a few days before or after treatment with or exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting drugs, pesticides, or chemicals. Do not apply within 21 days of slaughter. For use on beef cattle only. Do not treat sick, convalescent, or stressed cattle, or calves less than 3 months old except in Federal or State eradication programs where immediate treatment of all animals in an infested herd is mandatory. Be sure free access to drinking water is available to cattle prior to dipping. Do not dip excessively thirsty animals. Do not dip animals when overheated. Repeat treatment as necessary but not more often than every 7 to 10 days. Treatment for lice, ticks, hornflies, and scabies mites may be made any time of the year except when cattle grub larvae are in the gullet or spinal canal. Treatment for lice, ticks, and scabies mites may be made any time 7 to 10 days following treatment for grubs. Do not treat grubs when the grub larvae are in the gullet or spinal canal. Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing. Do not breathe spray mist. Wear rubber gloves, goggles, and protective clothing. In case of skin contact, wash immediately with soap and water; for eyes, flush with water. Wash all contaminated clothing with soap and hot water before re-use.

<DIV8 N="530.1" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="6">
<HEAD>§ 530.1   Scope.</HEAD>
<P>This part applies to the extralabel use in an animal of any approved new animal drug or approved new human drug by or on the lawful order of a licensed veterinarian within the context of a valid veterinary-client-patient relationship.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="530.2" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="6">
<HEAD>§ 530.2   Purpose.</HEAD>
<P>The purpose of this part is to establish conditions for extralabel use or intended extralabel use in animals by or on the lawful order of licensed veterinarians of Food and Drug Administration approved new animal drugs and approved new human drugs. Such use is limited to treatment modalities when the health of an animal is threatened or suffering or death may result from failure to treat. This section implements the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994 (the AMDUCA) (Pub. L. 103-396).

<DIV8 N="530.3" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="6">
<HEAD>§ 530.3   Definitions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Extralabel use</I> means actual use or intended use of a drug in an animal in a manner that is not in accordance with the approved labeling. This includes, but is not limited to, use in species not listed in the labeling, use for indications (disease or other conditions) not listed in the labeling, use at dosage levels, frequencies, or routes of administration other than those stated in the labeling, and deviation from the labeled withdrawal time based on these different uses.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>FDA</I> means the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>(c) The phrase <I>a reasonable probability that a drug's use may present a risk to the public health</I> means that FDA has reason to believe that use of a drug may be likely to cause a potential adverse event.
</P>
<P>(d) The phrase <I>use of a drug may present a risk to the public health</I> means that FDA has information that indicates that use of a drug may cause an adverse event.
</P>
<P>(e) The phrase <I>use of a drug presents a risk to the public health</I> means that FDA has evidence that demonstrates that the use of a drug has caused or likely will cause an adverse event.
</P>
<P>(f) A <I>residue</I> means any compound present in edible tissues that results from the use of a drug, and includes the drug, its metabolites, and any other substance formed in or on food because of the drug's use.
</P>
<P>(g) A <I>safe level</I> is a conservative estimate of a drug residue level in edible animal tissue derived from food safety data or other scientific information. Concentrations of residues in tissue below the safe level will not raise human food safety concerns. A safe level is not a safe concentration or a tolerance and does not indicate that an approval exists for the drug in that species or category of animal from which the food is derived.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Veterinarian</I> means a person licensed by a State or Territory to practice veterinary medicine.
</P>
<P>(i) A <I>valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship</I> is one in which:
</P>
<P>(1) A veterinarian has assumed the responsibility for making medical judgments regarding the health of (an) animal(s) and the need for medical treatment, and the client (the owner of the animal or animals or other caretaker) has agreed to follow the instructions of the veterinarian;
</P>
<P>(2) There is sufficient knowledge of the animal(s) by the veterinarian to initiate at least a general or preliminary diagnosis of the medical condition of the animal(s); and
</P>
<P>(3) The practicing veterinarian is readily available for followup in case of adverse reactions or failure of the regimen of therapy. Such a relationship can exist only when the veterinarian has recently seen and is personally acquainted with the keeping and care of the animal(s) by virtue of examination of the animal(s), and/or by medically appropriate and timely visits to the premises where the animal(s) are kept.

</P>
<P>(d) The agency may publish an order of prohibition with a shorter comment period and/or delayed effective date than specified in paragraph (b) of this section in exceptional circumstances (e.g., where there is immediate risk to the public health), provided that the order of prohibition states that the comment period and/or effective date have been abbreviated because there are exceptional circumstances, and the order of prohibition sets forth the agency's rationale for taking such action.
</P>
<P>(e) If FDA publishes a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> modifying an order of prohibition, the agency will specify in the modified order of prohibition the nature and extent of the modified prohibition, the reasons for it, and the agency's response to any comments on the original order of prohibition.
</P>
<P>(f) A current listing of drugs prohibited for extralabel use in animals will be codified in § 530.41.
</P>
<P>(g) After the submission of appropriate information (i.e., adequate data, an acceptable method, approval of a new animal drug application for the prohibited extralabel use, or information demonstrating that the prohibition was based on incorrect data), FDA may, by publication of an appropriate notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> remove a drug from the list of human and animal drugs prohibited for extralabel use in animals, or may modify a prohibition.

<HEAD>§ 556.1   Scope.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires an applicant seeking approval or conditional approval of a new animal drug to submit a proposed tolerance as part of its new animal drug application when such a tolerance is needed to assure that the proposed use of the new animal drug will be safe (see sections 512(b)(1)(H) and 571(a)(2)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act). FDA assigns tolerances for animal drugs used in food-producing animals as part of the application approval process. Tolerances for approved and conditionally approved new animal drugs are codified in subpart B of this part.
</P>
<P>(b) Compounds that have been found to be carcinogenic are regulated under subpart E of part 500 of this chapter.

<HEAD>§ 556.3   Definitions.</HEAD>
<P>As used in this part:
</P>
<P><I>Acceptable daily intake (ADI)</I> means the daily intake which, during up to an entire life of a human, appears to be without adverse effects or harm to the health of the consumer. The ADI most often will be set on the basis of the drug's toxicological, microbiological, or pharmacological properties. It is usually expressed in micrograms or milligrams of the chemical per kilogram of body weight per day.
</P>
<P><I>Acute reference dose (ARfD)</I> means an estimate of the amount of residues expressed on a body weight basis that can be ingested in a period of 24 hours or less without adverse effects or harm to the health of the human consumer.
</P>
<P><I>Edible tissues</I> means muscle, liver, kidney, fat, skin with fat in natural proportions, whole eggs, whole milk, and honey.
</P>
<P><I>Marker residue</I> means the residue whose concentration is in a known relationship to the concentration of total residue in an edible tissue.
</P>
<P><I>mg/kg</I> means milligrams per kilogram.
</P>
<P><I>Not required,</I> in reference to tolerances in this part, means that at the time of approval:
</P>
<P>(1) No withdrawal period was necessary for residues of the drug to deplete to or below the concentrations considered to be safe, or an adequate withdrawal period was inherent in the proposed drug use, and there was a rapid depletion of residues, so there was no concern about residues resulting from misuse or overdosing; or
</P>
<P>(2) No withdrawal period was necessary because the drug was poorly absorbed or metabolized rapidly so as to make selection of an analyte impractical or impossible.
</P>
<P><I>ppb</I> means parts per billion (equivalent to nanograms per gram (ng/g) or µg/kg).
</P>
<P><I>ppm</I> means parts per million (equivalent to micrograms per gram (µg/g) or mg/kg).
</P>
<P><I>ppt</I> means parts per trillion (equivalent to picograms per gram (pg/g) or nanograms per kilogram (ng/kg)).
</P>
<P><I>Residue</I> means any compound present in edible tissues that results from the use of a drug, and includes the drug, its metabolites, and any other substance formed in or on food because of the drug's use.
</P>
<P><I>Target tissue</I> means the edible tissue selected to monitor for residues in the target animals.
</P>
<P><I>Tolerance</I> means the maximum concentration of a marker residue, or other residue indicated for monitoring, that can legally remain in a specific edible tissue of a treated animal.
</P>
<P><I>Total residue</I> means the aggregate of all compounds that results from the use of an animal drug, including the drug, its metabolites, and any other substances formed in or on food because of such drug use.
</P>
<P><I>µg/kg</I> means microgram per kilogram.
</P>
<P><I>Zero,</I> in reference to tolerances in this part, means any residues detected in the edible tissue renders it unsafe.

Approved and conditionally approved conditions of use in parts 516, 520, 522, 524, 526, 529, and 558 of this chapter, including the species and production classes of animals, are referenced in each tolerance section in subpart B of this part.
</P>
<P>(b) All tolerances refer to the concentrations of a marker residue, or other residue indicated for monitoring, permitted in uncooked tissues.
</P>
<P>(c) After a tolerance is listed, the finding that the concentration of the marker residue in the target tissue from a tested animal is at or below the tolerance indicates that all edible tissues (excluding milk and eggs unless otherwise indicated) from that tested animal are safe for human consumption. If a listed tolerance is not expressly linked to a target tissue, then the tolerance is specific only for the named edible tissue and inferences cannot be made about the safety of the other edible tissues from the tested animal.
</P>
<P>(d) FDA requires that a drug sponsor submit a practicable method as part of their new animal drug application. FDA uses the practicable method to determine the quantity of the drug residues that can safely remain in edible tissues (<I>i.e.,</I> the tolerance), the withdrawal period, and any other use restrictions necessary to ensure that the proposed use of the drug will be safe.

<HEAD>§ 814.100   Purpose and scope.</HEAD>
<P>(a) This subpart H implements sections 515A and 520(m) of the act.
</P>
<P>(b) The purpose of section 520(m) is, to the extent consistent with the protection of the public health and safety and with ethical standards, to encourage the discovery and use of devices intended to benefit patients in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases or conditions that affect or are manifested in not more than 8,000 individuals in the United States per year. This subpart provides procedures for obtaining:
</P>
<P>(1) HUD designation of a medical device; and
</P>
<P>(2) Marketing approval for the HUD notwithstanding the absence of reasonable assurance of effectiveness that would otherwise be required under sections 514 and 515 of the act.
</P>
<P>(c) Section 515A of the act is intended to ensure the submission of readily available information concerning:
</P>
<P>(1) Any pediatric subpopulations (neonates, infants, children, adolescents) that suffer from the disease or condition that the device is intended to treat, diagnose, or cure; and
</P>
<P>(2) The number of affected pediatric patients.
</P>
<P>(d) Although a HUD may also have uses that differ from the humanitarian use, applicants seeking approval of any non-HUD use shall submit a PMA as required under § 814.20, or a premarket notification as required under part 807 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(e) Obtaining marketing approval for a HUD involves two steps:
</P>
<P>(1) Obtaining designation of the device as a HUD from FDA's Office of Orphan Products Development, and 
</P>
<P>(2) Submitting an HDE to the Office of Product Evaluation and Quality (OPEQ), Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), or the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), as applicable.
</P>
<P>(f) A person granted an exemption under section 520(m) of the act shall submit periodic reports as described in § 814.126(b).
</P>
<P>(g) FDA may suspend or withdraw approval of an HDE after providing notice and an opportunity for an informal hearing.

<P>(2) The name and address of the applicant, the name of the applicant's primary contact person and/or resident agent, including title, address, and telephone number;
</P>
<P>(3) A description of the rare disease or condition for which the device is to be used, the proposed indication or indications for use of the device, and the reasons why such therapy is needed. If the device is proposed for an indication that represents a subset of a common disease or condition, a demonstration that the subset is medically plausible should be included;
</P>
<P>(4) A description of the device and a discussion of the scientific rationale for the use of the device for the rare disease or condition; and 
</P>
<P>(5) Documentation, with appended authoritative references, to demonstrate that the device is designed to treat or diagnose a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in not more than 8,000 people in the United States per year. If the device is for diagnostic purposes, the documentation must demonstrate that not more than 8,000 patients per year would be subjected to diagnosis by the device in the United States. Authoritative references include literature citations in specialized medical journals, textbooks, specialized medical society proceedings, or governmental statistics publications. When no such studies or literature citations exist, the applicant may be able to demonstrate the prevalence of the disease or condition in the United States by providing credible conclusions from appropriate research or surveys. 
</P>
<P>(b) <I>FDA action.</I> Within 45 days of receipt of a request for HUD designation, FDA will take one of the following actions: 
</P>
<P>(1) Approve the request and notify the applicant that the device has been designated as a HUD based on the information submitted;
</P>
<P>(2) Return the request to the applicant pending further review upon submission of additional information. This action will ensue if the request is incomplete because it does not on its face contain all of the information required under § 814.102(a). Upon receipt of this additional information, the review period may be extended up to 45 days; or
</P>
<P>(3) Disapprove the request for HUD designation based on a substantive review of the information submitted. FDA may disapprove a request for HUD designation if:
</P>
<P>(i) There is insufficient evidence to support the estimate that the disease or condition for which the device is designed to treat or diagnose affects or is manifested in not more than 8,000 people in the United States per year;
</P>
<P>(ii) FDA determines that, for a diagnostic device, more than 8,000 patients in the United States would be subjected to diagnosis using the device per year; or
</P>
<P>(iii) FDA determines that the patient population defined in the request is not a medically plausible subset of a larger population.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Revocation of designation.</I> FDA may revoke a HUD designation if the agency finds that: 
</P>
<P>(1) The request for designation contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted material information; or
</P>
<P>(2) Based on the evidence available, the device is not eligible for HUD designation.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Submission.</I> The applicant shall submit two copies of a completed, dated, and signed request for HUD designation to: Office of Orphan Products Development (HF-35), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.

<P>(a) <I>Substantive review.</I> FDA will begin substantive review of an HDE after the HDE is accepted for filing under § 814.112. FDA may refer an original HDE application to a panel on its own initiative, and shall do so upon the request of an applicant, unless FDA determines that the application substantially duplicates information previously reviewed by a panel. If the HDE is referred to a panel, the agency shall follow the procedures set forth under § 814.44, with the exception that FDA will complete its review of the HDE and the advisory committee report and recommendations within 75 days from receipt of an HDE that is accepted for filing under § 814.112 or the date of filing as determined under § 814.106, whichever is later. Within the later of these two timeframes, FDA will issue an approval order under paragraph (b) of this section, an approvable letter under paragraph (c) of this section, a not approvable letter under paragraph (d) of this section, or an order denying approval of the application under § 814.118(a).
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Approval order.</I> FDA will issue to the applicant an order approving an HDE if none of the reasons in § 814.118 for denying approval of the application applies. FDA will approve an application on the basis of draft final labeling if the only deficiencies in the application concern editorial or similar minor deficiencies in the draft final labeling. Such approval will be conditioned upon the applicant incorporating the specified labeling changes exactly as directed and upon the applicant submitting to FDA a copy of the final printed labeling before marketing. The notice of approval of an HDE will be placed on the FDA's home page on the internet (<I>https://www.fda.gov</I>) in accordance with the rules and policies applicable to PMAs submitted under § 814.20. Following the issuance of an approval order, data and information in the HDE file will be available for public disclosure in accordance with § 814.9(b) through (h), as applicable.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Approvable letter.</I> FDA will send the applicant an approvable letter if the application substantially meets the requirements of this subpart and the agency believes it can approve the application if specific additional information is submitted or specific conditions are agreed to by the applicant. The approvable letter will describe the information FDA requires to be provided by the applicant or the conditions the applicant is required to meet to obtain approval. For example, FDA may require as a condition to approval:
</P>
<P>(1) The submission of certain information identified in the approvable letter, e.g., final labeling;
</P>
<P>(2) The submission of additional information concerning pediatric uses of the device, as required by § 814.20(b)(13);
</P>
<P>(3) Restrictions imposed on the device under section 520(e) of the act;
</P>
<P>(4) Postapproval requirements as described in subpart E of this part; and
</P>
<P>(5) An FDA inspection that finds the manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls in compliance with part 820 of this chapter and, if applicable, that verifies records pertinent to the HDE. 
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Not approvable letter.</I> FDA will send the applicant a not approvable letter if the agency believes that the application may not be approved for one or more of the reasons given in § 814.118. The not approvable letter will describe the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify measures required to place the HDE in approvable form. The applicant may respond to the not approvable letter in the same manner as permitted for not approvable letters for PMA's under § 814.44(f), with the exception that if a major HDE amendment is submitted, the review period may be extended up to 75 days.

<P>(e) FDA will consider an HDE to have been withdrawn voluntarily if:
</P>
<P>(1) The applicant fails to respond in writing to a written request for an amendment within 75 days after the date FDA issues such request;
</P>
<P>(2) The applicant fails to respond in writing to an approvable or not approvable letter within 75 days after the date FDA issues such letter; or
</P>
<P>(3) The applicant submits a written notice to FDA that the HDE has been withdrawn.

<P>(a) <I>Applicability.</I> (1) Current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements are set forth in this quality system regulation. The requirements in this part govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all finished devices intended for human use. The requirements in this part are intended to ensure that finished devices will be safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). This part establishes basic requirements applicable to manufacturers of finished medical devices. If a manufacturer engages in only some operations subject to the requirements in this part, and not in others, that manufacturer need only comply with those requirements applicable to the operations in which it is engaged. With respect to class I devices, design controls apply only to those devices listed in § 820.30(a)(2). This regulation does not apply to manufacturers of components or parts of finished devices, but such manufacturers are encouraged to use appropriate provisions of this regulation as guidance. Manufacturers of blood and blood components used for transfusion or for further manufacturing are not subject to this part, but are subject to subchapter F of this chapter. Manufacturers of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), as defined in § 1271.3(d) of this chapter, that are medical devices (subject to premarket review or notification, or exempt from notification, under an application submitted under the device provisions of the act or under a biological product license application under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act) are subject to this part and are also subject to the donor-eligibility procedures set forth in part 1271 subpart C of this chapter and applicable current good tissue practice procedures in part 1271 subpart D of this chapter. In the event of a conflict between applicable regulations in part 1271 and in other parts of this chapter, the regulation specifically applicable to the device in question shall supersede the more general.
</P>
<P>(2) The provisions of this part shall be applicable to any finished device as defined in this part, intended for human use, that is manufactured, imported, or offered for import in any State or Territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>(3) In this regulation the term “where appropriate” is used several times. When a requirement is qualified by “where appropriate,” it is deemed to be “appropriate” unless the manufacturer can document justification otherwise. A requirement is “appropriate” if nonimplementation could reasonably be expected to result in the product not meeting its specified requirements or the manufacturer not being able to carry out any necessary corrective action. 
</P>
<P>(b) The quality system regulation in this part supplements regulations in other parts of this chapter except where explicitly stated otherwise. In the event of a conflict between applicable regulations in this part and in other parts of this chapter, the regulations specifically applicable to the device in question shall supersede any other generally applicable requirements.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Authority.</I> Part 820 is established and issued under authority of sections 501, 502, 510, 513, 514, 515, 518, 519, 520, 522, 701, 704, 801, 803 of the act (21 U.S.C. 351, 352, 360, 360c, 360d, 360e, 360h, 360i, 360j, 360l, 371, 374, 381, 383). The failure to comply with any applicable provision in this part renders a device adulterated under section 501(h) of the act. Such a device, as well as any person responsible for the failure to comply, is subject to regulatory action. 
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Foreign manufacturers.</I> If a manufacturer who offers devices for import into the United States refuses to permit or allow the completion of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection of the foreign facility for the purpose of determining compliance with this part, it shall appear for purposes of section 801(a) of the act, that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, or servicing of any devices produced at such facility that are offered for import into the United States do not conform to the requirements of section 520(f) of the act and this part and that the devices manufactured at that facility are adulterated under section 501(h) of the act. 
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Exemptions or variances.</I> (1) Any person who wishes to petition for an exemption or variance from any device quality system requirement is subject to the requirements of section 520(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Petitions for an exemption or variance shall be submitted according to the procedures set forth in § 10.30 of this chapter, the FDA's administrative procedures. For guidance on how to proceed for a request for a variance, contact Division of Regulatory Programs 2, Office of Regulatory Programs, Office of Product Evaluation and Quality, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 66, Rm. 1438, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002.
</P>
<P>(2) FDA may initiate and grant a variance from any device quality system requirement when the agency determines that such variance is in the best interest of the public health. Such variance will remain in effect only so long as there remains a public health need for the device and the device would not likely be made sufficiently available without the variance.

<HEAD>Subpart A—General Provisions</HEAD>


<DIV8 N="821.1" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="8">
<HEAD>§ 821.1   Scope.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The regulations in this part implement section 519(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), which provides that the Food and Drug Administration may require a manufacturer to adopt a method of tracking a class II or class III device, if the device meets one of the following three criteria and FDA issues an order to the manufacturer: the failure of the device would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences; or the device is intended to be implanted in the human body for more than 1 year; or the device is a life-sustaining or life-supporting device used outside a device user facility. A device that meets one of these criteria and is the subject of an FDA order must comply with this part and is referred to, in this part, as a “tracked device.”
</P>
<P>(b) These regulations are intended to ensure that tracked devices can be traced from the device manufacturing facility to the person for whom the device is indicated, that is, the patient. Effective tracking of devices from the manufacturing facility, through the distributor network (including distributors, retailers, rental firms and other commercial enterprises, device user facilities, and licensed practitioners) and, ultimately, to the patient is necessary for the effectiveness of remedies prescribed by the act, such as patient notification (section 518(a) of the act) or device recall (section 518(e) of the act). Although these regulations do not preclude a manufacturer from involving outside organizations in that manufacturer's device tracking effort, the legal responsibility for complying with this part rests with manufacturers who are subject to tracking orders, and that responsibility cannot be altered, modified, or in any way abrogated by contracts or other agreements.
</P>
<P>(c) The primary burden for ensuring that the tracking system works rests upon the manufacturer. A manufacturer or any other person, including a distributor, final distributor, or multiple distributor, who distributes a device subject to tracking, who fails to comply with any applicable requirement of section 519(e) of the act or of this part, or any person who causes such failure, misbrands the device within the meaning of section 502(t)(2) of the act and commits a prohibited act within the meaning of sections 301(e) and 301(q)(1)(B) of the act.
</P>
<P>(d) Any person subject to this part who permanently discontinues doing business is required to notify FDA at the time the person notifies any government agency, court, or supplier, and provide FDA with a complete set of its tracking records and information. However, if a person ceases distribution of a tracked device but continues to do other business, that person continues to be responsible for compliance with this part unless another person, affirmatively and in writing, assumes responsibility for continuing the tracking of devices previously distributed under this part. Further, if a person subject to this part goes out of business completely, but other persons acquire the right to manufacture or distribute tracked devices, those other persons are deemed to be responsible for continuing the tracking responsibility of the previous person under this part.

<HEAD>§ 860.3   Definitions.</HEAD>
<P>For the purposes of this part:
</P>
<P><I>Class</I> means one of the three categories of regulatory control for medical devices, defined as follows:
</P>
<P><I>Class I</I> means the class of devices that are subject only to the general controls authorized by or under sections 501 (adulteration), 502 (misbranding), 510 (registration), 516 (banned devices), 518 (notification and other remedies), 519 (records and reports), and 520 (general provisions) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. A device is in class I if:
</P>
<P>(1) General controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device, or
</P>
<P>(2) There is insufficient information from which to determine that general controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device or to establish special controls to provide such assurance, but the device is not life-supporting or life-sustaining, or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, and which does not present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
</P>
<P><I>Class II</I> means the class of devices that is or eventually will be subject to special controls. A device is in class II if general controls alone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness and there is sufficient information to establish special controls, including the promulgation of performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries, development and dissemination of guidelines (including guidelines for the submission of clinical data in premarket notification submissions in accordance with section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act), recommendations, and other appropriate actions as the Commissioner deems necessary to provide such assurance. For a device that is purported or represented to be for use in supporting or sustaining human life, the Commissioner shall examine and identify the special controls, if any, which are necessary to provide adequate assurance of safety and effectiveness, and describe how such controls provide such assurance.
</P>
<P><I>Class III</I> means the class of devices for which premarket approval is or will be required in accordance with section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. A device is in class III if insufficient information exists to determine that general controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness, or that application of special controls described in the definition of “<I>Class II”</I> in this section in addition to general controls, would provide such assurance, and if, in addition, the device is life-supporting or life-sustaining, or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or if the device presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
</P>
<P><I>Classification panel</I> means one of the several advisory committees established by the Commissioner under section 513 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and part 14 of this chapter for the purpose of making recommendations to the Commissioner on the classification and reclassification of devices and for other purposes prescribed by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or by the Commissioner.
</P>
<P><I>Classification regulation</I> means a section under parts 862 through 892 of this chapter that contains the identification (general description and intended use) and classification (class I, II or III) of a single device type or more than one related device type(s).
</P>
<P><I>Commissioner</I> means the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Food and Drug Administration, United States Department of Health and Human Services, or the Commissioner's designee.
</P>
<P><I>De Novo request</I> means any submission under section 513(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for a medical device, requesting classification into class I or class II, including all information submitted with or incorporated by reference therein.
</P>
<P><I>FDA</I> means the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P><I>General controls</I> mean the controls authorized by or under sections 501 (adulteration), 502 (misbranding), 510 (registration, listing, and premarket notification), 516 (banned devices), 518 (notification and other remedies), 519 (records, reports, and unique device identification), and 520 (general provisions) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P><I>Generic type of device</I> means a grouping of devices that do not differ significantly in purpose, design, materials, energy source, function, or any other feature related to safety and effectiveness, and for which similar regulatory controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
</P>
<P><I>Implant</I> means a device that is placed into a surgically or naturally formed cavity of the human body. A device is regarded as an implant for the purpose of this part only if it is intended to remain implanted continuously for a period of 30 days or more, unless the Commissioner determines otherwise to protect human health.
</P>
<P><I>Life-supporting or life-sustaining device</I> means a device that is essential to, or that yields information that is essential to, the restoration or continuation of a bodily function important to the continuation of human life.
</P>
<P><I>Petition</I> means a submission seeking reclassification of a device in accordance with § 860.123.
</P>
<P><I>Special controls</I> mean the controls necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for a generic type of device that is class II. Special controls include performance standards, performance testing, postmarket surveillance, patient registries, development and dissemination of guidelines (including guidelines for the submission of clinical data in premarket notification submissions in accordance with section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act), recommendations, and other appropriate actions, as the Commissioner deems necessary to provide such assurance.

<HEAD>§ 860.5   Confidentiality and use of data and information submitted in connection with classification and reclassification.</HEAD>
<P>(a) This section governs the availability for public disclosure and the use by the Commissioner of data and information submitted to classification panels or to the Commissioner in connection with the classification or reclassification of devices under this part.
</P>
<P>(b) In general, data and information submitted to classification panels in connection with the classification of devices under § 860.84 will be available immediately for public disclosure upon request. However, except as provided by the special rules in paragraph (c) of this section, this provision does not apply to data and information exempt from public disclosure in accordance with part 20 of this chapter: Such data and information will be available only in accordance with part 20.
</P>
<P>(c)(1) Safety and effectiveness data submitted to classification panels or to the Commissioner in connection with the classification of a device under § 860.84, which have not been disclosed previously to the public, as described in § 20.81 of this chapter, shall be regarded as confidential if the device is classified in to class III. Because the classification of a device under § 860.84 may be ascertained only upon publication of a final regulation, all safety and effectiveness data that have not been disclosed previously are not available for public disclosure unless and until the device is classified into class I or II, in which case the procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. 
</P>
<P>(2) Thirty days after publication of a final regulation under § 860.84 classifying a device into class I or class II, safety and effectiveness data submitted for that device that had been regarded as confidential under paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be available for public disclosure and placed on public display in the office of the Dockets Management Staff, Food and Drug Administration unless, within that 30-day period, the person who submitted the data demonstrates that the data still fall within the exemption for trade secrets and confidential commercial information described in § 20.61 of this chapter. Safety and effectiveness data submitted for a device that is classified into class III by regulation in accordance with § 860.84 will remain confidential and unavailable for public disclosure so long as such data have not been disclosed to the public as described in § 20.81 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(3) Because device classification affects generic types of devices, in making determinations under § 860.84 concerning the initial classification of a device, the classification panels and the Commissioner may consider safety and effectiveness data developed for another device in the same generic type, regardless of whether such data are regarded currently as confidential under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
</P>
<P>(d)(1) The fact of its existence and the contents of a petition for reclassification filed in accordance with § 860.130 or § 860.132 are available for public disclosure at the time the petition is received by the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>(2) The fact of the existence of a petition for reclassification filed in accordance with § 860.134 or § 860.136 is available for public disclosure at the time the petition is received by the Food and Drug Administration. The contents of such a petition are not available for public disclosure for the period of time following its receipt (not longer than 30 days) during which the petition is reviewed for any deficiencies preventing the Commissioner from making a decision on it. Once it is determined that the petition contains no deficiencies preventing the Commissioner from making a decision on it, the petition will be filed with the Dockets Management Staff and its entire contents will be available for public disclosure and subject to consideration by classification panels and by the Commissioner in making a decision on the petition. If, during this 30-day period of time, the petition is found to contain deficiencies that prevent the Commissioner from making a decision on it, the petitioner will be so notified and afforded an opportunity to correct the deficiencies.
</P>
<FP>Thirty days after notice to the petitioner of deficiencies in the petition, the contents of the petition will be available for public disclosure unless, within that 30 days, the petitioner submits supplemental material intended to correct the deficiencies in the petition. The Commissioner, in the Commissioner's discretion, may allow withdrawal of a deficient petition during the 30-day period provided for correcting deficiencies. Any supplemental material submitted by the petitioner, together with the material in the original petition, is considered as a new petition. The new petition is reviewed for deficiencies in the same manner as the original petition, and the same procedures for notification and correction of deficiencies are followed. Once the petitioner has corrected the deficiencies, the entire contents of the petition will be available for public disclosure and subject to consideration by classification panels and by the Commissioner in making a decision on the petition. Deficient petitions which have not been corrected within 180 days after notification of deficiency will be returned to the petitioner and will not be considered further unless resubmitted. 
</FP>
<P>(e) The Commissioner may not disclose, or use as the basis for reclassification of a device from class III to class II, any information reported to or otherwise obtained by the Commissioner under section 513, 514, 515, 516, 518, 519, 520(f), 520(g), or 704 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that falls within the exemption described in § 20.61 of this chapter for trade secrets and confidential commercial information. The exemption described in § 20.61 does not apply to data or information contained in a petition for reclassification submitted in accordance with § 860.130 or § 860.132, or in a petition submitted in accordance with § 860.134 or § 860.136 that has been determined to contain no deficiencies that prevent the Commissioner from making a decision on it. Accordingly, all data and information contained in such petitions may be disclosed by the Commissioner and used as the basis for reclassification of a device from class III to class II.
</P>
<P>(f) For purposes of this section, safety and effectiveness data include data and results derived from all studies and tests of a device on animals and humans and from all studies and tests of the device itself intended to establish or determine its safety and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>(g) Confidentiality of data and information in a De Novo file is as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) A “De Novo file” includes all data and information from the requester submitted with or incorporated by reference in the De Novo request, any De Novo supplement, or any other related submission relevant to the administrative file, as defined in § 10.3(a) of this chapter. Any record in the De Novo file will be available for public disclosure in accordance with the provisions of this section and part 20 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(2) The existence of a De Novo file may not be disclosed by FDA before an order granting the De Novo request is issued unless it previously has been publicly disclosed or acknowledged by the De Novo requester.
</P>
<P>(3) Before an order granting the De Novo request is issued, data or information contained in the De Novo file is not available for public disclosure, except to the extent the existence of the De Novo file is disclosable under paragraph (g)(2) of this section and such data or information has been publicly disclosed or acknowledged by the De Novo requester.
</P>
<P>(4) After FDA issues an order granting a De Novo request, the data and information in the De Novo file that are not exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, are immediately available for public disclosure.

<DIV8 N="860.7" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="8">
<HEAD>§ 860.7   Determination of safety and effectiveness.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The classification panels, in reviewing evidence concerning the safety and effectiveness of a device and in preparing advice to the Commissioner, and the Commissioner, in making determinations concerning the safety and effectiveness of a device, will apply the rules in this section.
</P>
<P>(b) In determining the safety and effectiveness of a device for purposes of classification, establishment of special controls for class II devices, and premarket approval of class III devices, the Commissioner and the classification panels will consider the following, among other relevant factors:
</P>
<P>(1) The persons for whose use the device is represented or intended;
</P>
<P>(2) The conditions of use for the device, including conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or advertising of the device, and other intended conditions of use;
</P>
<P>(3) The probable benefit to health from the use of the device weighed against any probable injury or illness from such use; and 
</P>
<P>(4) The reliability of the device. 
</P>
<P>(c)(1) Although the manufacturer may submit any form of evidence to the Food and Drug Administration in an attempt to substantiate the safety and effectiveness of a device, the agency relies upon only valid scientific evidence to determine whether there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective. After considering the nature of the device and the rules in this section, the Commissioner will determine whether the evidence submitted or otherwise available to the Commissioner is valid scientific evidence for the purpose of determining the safety or effectiveness of a particular device and whether the available evidence, when taken as a whole, is adequate to support a determination that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its conditions of use. 
</P>
<P>(2) Valid scientific evidence is evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use. The evidence required may vary according to the characteristics of the device, its conditions of use, the existence and adequacy of warnings and other restrictions, and the extent of experience with its use. Isolated case reports, random experience, reports lacking sufficient details to permit scientific evaluation, and unsubstantiated opinions are not regarded as valid scientific evidence to show safety or effectiveness. Such information may be considered, however, in identifying a device with questionable safety or effectiveness.</P>
<P>(d)(1) There is reasonable assurance that a device is safe when it can be determined, based upon valid scientific evidence, that the probable benefits to health from use of the device for its intended uses and conditions of use, when accompanied by adequate directions and warnings against unsafe use, outweigh any probable risks. The valid scientific evidence used to determine the safety of a device shall adequately demonstrate the absence of unreasonable risk of illness or injury associated with the use of the device for its intended uses and conditions of use. 
</P>
<P>(2) Among the types of evidence that may be required, when appropriate, to determine that there is reasonable assurance that a device is safe are investigations using laboratory animals, investigations involving human subjects, nonclinical investigations, and analytical studies for in vitro diagnostic devices.
</P>
<P>(e)(1) There is reasonable assurance that a device is effective when it can be determined, based upon valid scientific evidence, that in a significant portion of the target population, the use of the device for its intended uses and conditions of use, when accompanied by adequate directions for use and warnings against unsafe use, will provide clinically significant results.
</P>
<P>(2) The valid scientific evidence used to determine the effectiveness of a device shall consist principally of well-controlled investigations, as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, unless the Commissioner authorizes reliance upon other valid scientific evidence which the Commissioner has determined is sufficient evidence from which to determine the effectiveness of a device, even in the absence of well-controlled investigations. The Commissioner may make such a determination where the requirement of well-controlled investigations in paragraph (f) of this section is not reasonably applicable to the device.
</P>
<P>(f) The following principles have been developed over a period of years and are recognized by the scientific community as the essentials of a well-controlled clinical investigation. They provide the basis for the Commissioner's determination whether there is reasonable assurance that a device is effective based upon well-controlled investigations and are also useful in assessing the weight to be given to other valid scientific evidence permitted under this section.
</P>
<P>(1) The plan or protocol for the study and the report of the results of a well-controlled investigation shall include the following:
</P>
<P>(i) A clear statement of the objectives of the study;
</P>
<P>(ii) A method of selection of the subjects that:
</P>
<P>(<I>a</I>) Provides adequate assurance that the subjects are suitable for the purposes of the study, provides diagnostic criteria of the condition to be treated or diagnosed, provides confirmatory laboratory tests where appropriate and, in the case of a device to prevent a disease or condition, provides evidence of susceptibility and exposure to the condition against which prophylaxis is desired;
</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) Assigns the subjects to test groups, if used, in such a way as to minimize any possible bias;
</P>
<P>(<I>c</I>) Assures comparability between test groups and any control groups of pertinent variables such as sex, severity or duration of the disease, and use of therapy other than the test device;
</P>
<P>(iii) An explanation of the methods of observation and recording of results utilized, including the variables measured, quantitation, assessment of any subject's response, and steps taken to minimize any possible bias of subjects and observers;
</P>
<P>(iv) A comparison of the results of treatment or diagnosis with a control in such a fashion as to permit quantitative evaluation. The precise nature of the control must be specified and an explanation provided of the methods employed to minimize any possible bias of the observers and analysts of the data. Level and methods of “blinding,” if appropriate and used, are to be documented. Generally, four types of comparisons are recognized:
</P>
<P>(<I>a</I>) <I>No treatments.</I> Where objective measurements of effectiveness are available and placebo effect is negligible, comparison of the objective results in comparable groups of treated and untreated patients;
</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) <I>Placebo control.</I> Where there may be a placebo effect with the use of a device, comparison of the results of use of the device with an ineffective device used under conditions designed to resemble the conditions of use under investigation as far as possible;
</P>
<P>(<I>c</I>) <I>Active treatment control.</I> Where an effective regimen of therapy may be used for comparison, e.g., the condition being treated is such that the use of a placebo or the withholding of treatment would be inappropriate or contrary to the interest of the patient;
</P>
<P>(<I>d</I>) <I>Historical control.</I> In certain circumstances, such as those involving diseases with high and predictable mortality or signs and symptoms of predictable duration or severity, or in the case of prophylaxis where morbidity is predictable, the results of use of the device may be compared quantitatively with prior experience historically derived from the adequately documented natural history of the disease or condition in comparable patients or populations who received no treatment or who followed an established effective regimen (therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic).
</P>
<P>(v) A summary of the methods of analysis and an evaluation of the data derived from the study, including any appropriate statistical methods utilized.
</P>
<P>(2) To insure the reliability of the results of an investigation, a well-controlled investigation shall involve the use of a test device that is standardized in its composition or design and performance. 
</P>
<P>(g)(1) It is the responsibility of each manufacturer and importer of a device to assure that adequate, valid scientific evidence exists, and to furnish such evidence to the Food and Drug Administration to provide reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses and conditions of use. The failure of a manufacturer or importer of a device to present to the Food and Drug Administration adequate, valid scientific evidence showing that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device, if regulated by general controls alone, or by general controls and special controls, may support a determination that the device be classified into class III.</P>
<P>(2) The Commissioner may require that a manufacturer, importer, or distributor make reports or provide other information bearing on the classification of a device and indicating whether there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device or whether it is adulterated or misbranded under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. 
</P>
<P>(3) A requirement for a report or other information under this paragraph will comply with section 519 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Accordingly, the requirement will state the reason or purpose for such request; will describe the required report or information as clearly as possible; will not be imposed on a manufacturer, importer, or distributor of a classified device that has been exempted from such a requirement in accordance with § 860.95; will prescribe the time for compliance with the requirement; and will prescribe the form and manner in which the report or information is to be provided. 
</P>
<P>(4) Required information that has been submitted previously to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, as applicable, need not be resubmitted, but may be incorporated by reference.

<DIV8 N="860.84" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="8">
<HEAD>§ 860.84   Classification procedures for “preamendments devices.”</HEAD>
<P>(a) This subpart sets forth the procedures for the original classification of a generic type of device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. Such a device will be classified by regulation into either class I (general controls), class II (special controls) or class III (premarket approval), depending upon the level of regulatory control required to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device (§ 860.3(c)). This subpart does not apply to a device that is classified into class III by statute under section 513(f)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because the Food and Drug Administration has determined that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to any device subject to this subpart or under section 520(<I>l</I>)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because the device was regarded previously as a new drug. In classifying a <I>preamendments</I> device to which this section applies, the Food and Drug Administration will follow the procedures described in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.
</P>
<P>(b) The Commissioner refers the device to the appropriate classification panel organized and operated in accordance with section 513 (b) and (c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and part 14 of this chapter. 
</P>
<P>(c) In order to make recommendations to the Commissioner on the class of regulatory control (class I, class II, or class III) appropriate for the device, the panel reviews the device for safety and effectiveness. In so doing, the panel: 
</P>
<P>(1) Considers the factors set forth in § 860.7 relating to the determination of safety and effectiveness; 
</P>
<P>(2) Determines the safety and effectiveness of the device on the basis of the types of scientific evidence set forth in § 860.7; and
</P>
<P>(3) Provides, to the maximum extent practicable, an opportunity for interested persons to submit data and views on the classification of the device in accordance with part 14 of this chapter. 
</P>
<P>(d) Based upon its review of evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the device, and applying the definition of each class in § 860.3(c), the panel submits to the Commissioner a recommendation regarding the classification of the device. The recommendation will include: 
</P>
<P>(1) A summary of the reasons for the recommendation; 
</P>
<P>(2) A summary of the data upon which the recommendation is based;
</P>
<P>(3) An identification of the risks to health (if any) presented by the device; 
</P>
<P>(4) In the case of a recommendation for classification into class I, a recommendation as to whether the device should be exempted from the requirements of one or more of the following sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: Section 510 (registration, product listing, and premarket notification), section 519 (records and reports), and section 520(f) (good manufacturing practice requirements of the quality system regulation) and, in the case of a recommendation for classification into class II, whether the device should be exempted from the premarket notification requirement under section 510, in accordance with § 860.15;
</P>
<P>(5) In the case of a recommendation for classification into class II or class III, to the extent practicable, a recommendation for the assignment to the device of a priority for the application of a performance standard or a premarket approval requirement, and in the case of classification into class II, a recommendation on the establishment of special controls and whether the device should be exempted from premarket notification in accordance with § 860.15; and
</P>
<P>(6) In the case of a recommendation for classification of an implant or a life-supporting or life-sustaining device into class I or class II, a statement of why premarket approval is not necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device and an identification of the risks to health, if any, presented by the device, in accordance with § 860.10.
</P>
<P>(e) A panel recommendation is regarded as preliminary until the Commissioner has reviewed it, discussed it with the panel if appropriate, and published a proposed regulation classifying the device. Preliminary panel recommendations are filed at Dockets Management Staff upon receipt and are available to the public at <I>https://www.regulations.gov.</I>
</P>
<P>(f) The Commissioner publishes the panel's recommendation in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> together with a proposed regulation classifying the device, and other devices of that generic type, and provides interested persons an opportunity to submit comments on the recommendation and proposed regulation.
</P>
<P>(g) The Commissioner reviews the comments and issues a final regulation classifying the device and other devices of that generic type. The regulation will:
</P>
<P>(1) If classifying the device into class I, prescribe which, if any, of the requirements of sections 510, 519, and 520(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act will not apply to the device and state the reasons for making the requirements inapplicable, in accordance with § 860.95;
</P>
<P>(2) If classifying the device into class II, establish the special controls for the device and prescribe whether the premarket notification requirement will apply to the device; and
</P>
<P>(3) If classifying an implant, or a life-supporting or life-sustaining device, comply with § 860.10(b).

<HEAD>§ 860.136   Procedures for transitional products under section 520(l) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Section 520(<I>l</I>)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act applies to reclassification proceedings initiated by the Commissioner or in response to a request by a manufacturer or importer for reclassification of a device currently in class III by operation of section 520(<I>l</I>)(1). This section applies only to devices that the Food and Drug Administration regarded as “new drugs” before May 28, 1976.
</P>
<P>(b) The procedures for effecting reclassification under section 520(<I>l</I>) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act when initiated by a manufacturer or importer are as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) The manufacturer or importer of the device files a petition for reclassification of the device in accordance with § 860.123. 
</P>
<P>(2) Within 30 days after the petition is filed, the Commissioner notifies the petitioner of any deficiencies in the petition that prevent the Commissioner from making a decision on it, allowing the petitioner to supplement a deficient petition. Within 30 days after any supplemental material is received, the Commissioner notifies the petitioner whether the petition, as supplemented, is adequate for review. 
</P>
<P>(3) The Commissioner consults with the appropriate classification panel with regard to the petition in accordance with § 860.125. 
</P>
<P>(4) Within 180 days after the petition is filed (where the Commissioner has determined it to be adequate for review), the Commissioner, by order in the form of a letter to the petitioner, either denies the petition or classifies the device into class I or class II in accordance with the criteria set forth in § 860.3(c).
</P>
<P>(5) Within a reasonable time after issuance of an order under this section, the Commissioner announces the order by notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> 
</P>
<P>(c) By administrative order, the Commissioner may, on the Commissioner's own initiative, change the classification from class III under section 520(<I>l</I>) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act either to class II, if the Commissioner determines that special controls in addition to general controls are necessary and sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device and there is sufficient information to establish special controls to provide such assurance, or to class I if the Commissioner determines that general controls alone would provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. The procedures for the reclassification proceeding under this paragraph (c) are as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) The Commissioner publishes a proposed reclassification order in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> seeking comment on the proposed reclassification.
</P>
<P>(2) The Commissioner may consult with the appropriate classification panel with respect to the reclassification of the device. The panel will consider reclassification in accordance with the consultation procedures of § 860.125.
</P>
<P>(3) Following consideration of comments to a public docket and any panel recommendations or comments, the Commissioner may change the classification of a device by final administrative order published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.
</P>
<P>(d) An administrative order under this section changing the classification of a device from class III to class II may establish the special controls necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device.

<HEAD>§ 862.2   Regulation of calibrators.</HEAD>
<P>Many devices classified in this part are intended to be used with a calibrator. A calibrator has a reference value assigned to it which serves as the basis by which test results of patients are derived or calculated. The calibrator for a device may be (a) manufactured and distributed separately from the device with which it is intended to be used, (b) manufactured and distributed as one of several device components, such as in a kit of reagents, or (c) built-in as an integral part of the device. Because of the central role that a calibrator plays in the measurement process and the critical effect calibrators have on accuracy of test results, elsewhere in this part, all three of these types of calibrators (§§ 862.1150 and 862.3200 of this part) are classified into class II, notwithstanding the classification of the device with which it is intended to be used. Thus, a device and its calibrator may have different classifications, even if the calibrator is built into the device.

<DIV8 N="862.3" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="8">
<HEAD>§ 862.3   Effective dates of requirement for premarket approval.</HEAD>
<P>A device included in this part that is classified into class III (premarket approval) shall not be commercially distributed after the date shown in the regulation classifying the device unless the manufacturer has an approval under section 515 of the act (unless an exemption has been granted under section 520(g)(2) of the act). An approval under section 515 of the act consists of FDA's issuance of an order approving an application for premarket approval (PMA) for the device or declaring completed a product development protocol (PDP) for the device. 
</P>
<P>(a) Before FDA requires that a device commercially distributed before the enactment date of the amendments, or a device that has been found substantially equivalent to such a device, has an approval under section 515 of the act FDA must promulgate a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring such approval, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Such a regulation under section 515(b) of the act shall not be effective during the grace period ending on the 90th day after its promulgation or on the last day of the 30th full calendar month after the regulation that classifies the device into class III is effective, whichever is later. See section 501(f)(2)(B) of the act. Accordingly, unless an effective date of the requirement for premarket approval is shown in the regulation for a device classified into class III in this part, the device may be commercially distributed without FDA's issuance of an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device. If FDA promulgates a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring premarket approval for a device, section 501(f)(1)(A) of the act applies to the device. 
</P>
<P>(b) Any new, not substantially equivalent, device introduced into commercial distribution on or after May 28, 1976, including a device formerly marketed that has been substantially altered, is classified by statute (section 513(f) of the act) into class III without any grace period and FDA must have issued an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device before the device is commercially distributed unless it is reclassified. If FDA knows that a device being commercially distributed may be a “new” device as defined in this section because of any new intended use or other reasons, FDA may codify the statutory classification of the device into class III for such new use. Accordingly, the regulation for such a class III device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution.

<P>The exemption from the requirement of premarket notification (section 510(k) of the act) for a generic type of class I or II device is only to the extent that the device has existing or reasonably foreseeable characteristics of commercially distributed devices within that generic type or, in the case of in vitro diagnostic devices, only to the extent that misdiagnosis as a result of using the device would not be associated with high morbidity or mortality. Accordingly, manufacturers of any commercially distributed class I or II device for which FDA has granted an exemption from the requirement of premarket notification must still submit a premarket notification to FDA before introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution the device when:
</P>
<P>(a) The device is intended for a use different from the intended use of a legally marketed device in that generic type of device; e.g., the device is intended for a different medical purpose, or the device is intended for lay use where the former intended use was by health care professionals only; 
</P>
<P>(b) The modified device operates using a different fundamental scientific technology than a legally marketed device in that generic type of device; e.g., a surgical instrument cuts tissue with a laser beam rather than with a sharpened metal blade, or an in vitro diagnostic device detects or identifies infectious agents by using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe or nucleic acid hybridization technology rather than culture or immunoassay technology; or

<P>(a) <I>Identification.</I> A wrist joint metal/polymer semi-constrained cemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace a wrist joint. The device limits translation and rotation in one or more planes via the geometry of its articulating surfaces. It has no linkage across-the-joint. This generic type of device includes prostheses that have either a one-part radial component made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, with an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene bearing surface, or a two-part radial component made of alloys and an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene ball that is mounted on the radial component with a trunnion bearing. The metallic portion of the two-part radial component is inserted into the radius. These devices have a metacarpal component(s) made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum. This generic type of device is limited to those prostheses intended for use with bone cement (§ 888.3027).

<P>A device included in this part that is classified into class III (premarket approval) shall not be commercially distributed after the date shown in the regulation classifying the device unless the manufacturer has an approval under section 515 of the act (unless an exemption has been granted under section 520(g)(2) of the act). An approval under section 515 of the act consists of FDA's issuance of an order approving an application of premarket approval (PMA) for the device or declaring completed a product development protocol (PDP) for the device. 
</P>
<P>(a) Before FDA requires that a device commercially distributed before the enactment date of the amendments, or a device that has been found substantially equivalent to such a device, has an approval under section 515 of the act FDA must promulgate a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring such approval, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Such a regulation under section 515(b) of the act shall not be effective during the grace period ending on the 90th day after its promulgation or on the last day of the 30th full calendar month after the regulation that classifies the device into class III is effective, whichever is later. See section 501(f)(2)(B) of the act. Accordingly, unless an effective date of the requirement for premarket approval is shown in the regulation for a device classified into class III in this part, the device may be commercially distributed without FDA's issuance of an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device. If FDA promulgates a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring premarket approval for a device, section 501(f)(1)(A) of the act applies to the device. 
</P>
<P>(b) Any new, not substantially equivalent, device introduced into commercial distribution on or after May 28, 1976, includiing a device formerly marketed that has been substantially altered, is classified by statute (section 513(f) of the act) into class III without any grace period and FDA must have issued an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device before the device is commercially distributed unless it is reclassified. If FDA knows that a device being commercially distributed may be a “new” device as defined in this section because of any new intended use or other reasons, FDA may codify the statutory classification of the device into class III for such new use. Accordingly, the regulation for such a class III device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution.

<HEAD>§ 892.3   Effective dates of requirement for premarket approval.</HEAD>
<P>A device included in this part that is classified into class III (premarket approval) shall not be commercially distributed after the date shown in the regulation classifying the device unless the manufacturer has an approval under section 515 of the act (unless an exemption has been granted under section 520(g)(2) of the act). An approval under section 515 of the act consists of FDA's issuance of an order approving an application for premarket approval (PMA) for the device or declaring completed a product development protocol (PDP) for the device.
</P>
<P>(a) Before FDA requires that a device commercially distributed before the enactment date of the amendments, or a device that has been found substantially equivalent to such a device, has an approval under section 515 of the act, FDA must promulgate a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring such approval, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Such a regulation under section 515(b) of the act shall not be effective during the grace period ending on the 90th day after its promulgation or on the last day of the 30th full calendar month after the regulation that classifies the device into class III is effective, whichever is later. See section 501(f)(2)(B) of the act. Accordingly, unless an effective date of the requirement for premarket approval is shown in the regulation for a device classified into class III in this part, the device may be commercially distributed without FDA's issuance of an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device. If FDA promulgates a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring premarket approval for a device, section 501(f)(1)(A) of the act applies to the device.
</P>
<P>(b) Any new, not substantially equivalent, device introduced into commercial distribution on or after May 28, 1976, including a device formerly marketed that has been substantially altered, is classified by statute (section 513(f) of the act) into class III without any grace period and FDA must have issued an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device before the device is commercially distributed unless it is reclassified. If FDA knows that a device being commercially distributed may be a “new” device as defined in this section because of any new intended use or other reasons, FDA may codify the statutory classification of the device into class III for such new use. Accordingly, the regulation for such a class III device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution.

<P>The exemption from the requirement of premarket notification (section 510(k) of the act) for a generic type of class I or II device is only to the extent that the device has existing or reasonably foreseeable characteristics of commercially distributed devices within that generic type or, in the case of in vitro diagnostic devices, only to the extent that misdiagnosis as a result of using the device would not be associated with high morbidity or mortality. Accordingly, manufacturers of any commercially distributed class I or II device for which FDA has granted an exemption from the requirement of premarket notification must still submit a premarket notification to FDA before introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution the device when:
</P>
<P>(a) The device is intended for a use different from the intended use of a legally marketed device in that generic type of device; e.g., the device is intended for a different medical purpose, or the device is intended for lay use where the former intended use was by health care professionals only;
</P>
<P>(b) The modified device operates using a different fundamental scientific technology than a legally marketed device in that generic type of device; e.g., a surgical instrument cuts tissue with a laser beam rather than with a sharpened metal blade, or an in vitro diagnostic device detects or identifies infectious agents by using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe or nucleic acid hybridization technology rather than culture or immunoassay technology; or
</P>
<P>(c) The device is an in vitro device that is intended:
</P>
<P>(1) For use in the diagnosis, monitoring, or screening of neoplastic diseases with the exception of immunohistochemical devices;
</P>
<P>(2) For use in screening or diagnosis of familial or acquired genetic disorders, including inborn errors of metabolism;
</P>
<P>(3) For measuring an analyte that serves as a surrogate marker for screening, diagnosis, or monitoring life-threatening diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), chronic or active hepatitis, tuberculosis, or myocardial infarction or to monitor therapy;

<HEAD>§ 895.22   Submission of data and information by the manufacturer, distributor, or importer.</HEAD>
<P>(a) A manufacturer, distributor, or importer of a device may be required to submit to the Food and Drug Administration all relevant and available data and information to enable the Commissioner to determine whether the device presents substantial deception, unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury, or unreasonable, direct, and substantial danger to the health of individuals. The data and information required by the Commissioner may include scientific or test data, reports, records, or other information, including data and information on whether the device is safe and effective for its intended use or when used as directed, whether the device performs according to the claims made for the device, and information on adulteration or misbranding. Any relevant information that is voluntarily submitted will also be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>(b) A manufacturer, distributor, or importer of a device required to submit data and information as provided in paragraph (a) of this section will be notified in writing by the Food and Drug Administration that such data and information shall be submitted. The written notification will advise the manufacturer, distributor, or importer of the device that the purpose for the request is to enable the Commissioner to determine whether any of the conditions listed in paragraph (a) of this section or § 895.30(a)(1) exists with respect to the device such that a proceeding should be initiated to make the device a banned device. When the required data and information can be identified by the Food and Drug Administration at the time of the notification, the agency will provide such identification to the manufacturer, distributor, or importer of the device. 
</P>
<P>(c) The required data and information shall be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration no more than 30 days after the date of receipt of the request, unless the Commissioner determines that the data and information shall be submitted by some other date and so informs the manufacturer, distributor, or importer, in which case the data and information shall be submitted on the date specified by the Commissioner. 
</P>
<P>(d) If the data or information submitted to the Food and Drug Administration is sufficient to persuade the Commissioner that the deception or risk of illness or injury or the danger to the health of individuals presented by a device could be corrected or eliminated by labeling or change in labeling, or change in advertising if the device is a restricted device, the Commissioner will proceed in accordance with § 895.25. 
</P>
<P>(e) If the data or information submitted to the Food and Drug Administration is insufficient to show that the device does not present a substantial deception or an unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury, or an unreasonable, direct, and substantial danger to the health of individuals, or if the manufacturer, distributor, or importer fails to submit the required information, the Commissioner may rely upon this insufficiency or failure to submit the required information in considering whether to initiate a proceeding to make the device a banned device under § 895.21(d) and, when appropriate, to establish a special effective date in accordance with § 895.30. The Commissioner may also initiate other regulatory action as provided in the act or this chapter.

<HEAD>§ 895.25   Labeling.</HEAD>
<P>(a) If the Commissioner determines that the substantial deception or unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury or the unreasonable, direct, and substantial danger to the health of individuals presented by a device can be corrected or eliminated by labeling or a change in labeling, or change in advertising if the device is a restricted device, the Commissioner will provide written notice to the manufacturer, distributor, importer, or any other person(s) responsible for the labeling or advertising of the device specifying: 
</P>
<P>(1) The deception or risk of illness or injury or the danger to the health of individuals, 
</P>
<P>(2) The labeling or change in labeling, or change in advertising if the device is a restricted device, necessary to correct the deception or eliminate or reduce such risk or danger, and 
</P>
<P>(3) The period of time within which the labeling, change in labeling, or change in advertising must be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>(b) In specifying the labeling or change in labeling or change in advertising to correct the deception or to eliminate or reduce the risk of illness or injury or the danger to the health of individuals, the Commissioner may require the manufacturer, distributor, importer, or any other person(s) responsible for the labeling or advertising of the device to include in labeling for the device, and in advertising if the device is a restricted device, a statement, notice, or warning. Such statement, notice, or warning shall be in the manner and form prescribed by the Commissioner and shall identify the deception or risk of illness or injury or the unreasonable, direct, and substantial danger to the health of individuals associated with the device as previously labeled. Such statement, notice, or warning shall be used in the labeling and advertising of the device for a time period specified by the Commissioner on the basis of the degree of deception, risk of illness or injury, or danger to health; the frequency of sale of the device; the length of time the device has been on the market; the intended uses of the device; the method of its use; and any other factors that the Commissioner considers pertinent. 
</P>
<P>(c) The Commissioner will allow a manufacturer, distributor, importer, or any other person(s) responsible for the labeling or advertising of the device a reasonable time, considering the deception or risk of illness or injury or the danger to the health of individuals presented by the device, within which to accomplish the required labeling, change in labeling, and, if the device is a restricted device, any change in advertising. The Commissioner may, however, request that no additional devices be introduced into commerce until the labeling or change in labeling, or change in advertising is accomplished by the manufacturer, distributor, importer, or other person(s) responsible for the labeling or advertising of the device. 
</P>
<P>(d) If such voluntary action is not taken, the Commissioner may take action under other sections of the act to prevent the introduction of the devices into commerce. The Commissioner may consider the failure of a manufacturer, distributor, importer, or any other person(s) responsible for the labeling or advertising of the device to accomplish the required labeling or change in labeling, or change in advertising in accordance with this section as a basis for initiating a proceeding to make a device a banned device in accordance with § 895.21(d) and when appropriate to establish a special effective date in accordance with § 895.30.

<P>(a) The Commissioner may declare a proposed regulation under § 895.21(d) to be effective upon its publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and until the effective date of any final action taken respecting the regulation if: 
</P>
<P>(1) The Commissioner determines, on the basis of all available data and information, that the deception or risk of illness or injury associated with use of the device that is subject to the regulation presents an unreasonable, direct, and substantial danger to the health of individuals, and 
</P>
<P>(2) Before the date of the publication of such regulation, the Commissioner notifies the domestic manufacturer and importer, if any, of the device that the regulation is to be made so effective. If necessary, the Commissioner may also notify the distributor or any other responsible person(s). In addition, the Commissioner will attempt to notify any foreign manufacturer when the name and address of the foreign manufacturer are readily available. 
</P>
<P>(b) This procedure may be used when the Commissioner determines that the potential or actual injury involved is a serious one that the Commissioner believes will endanger the health of individuals who have been, or will be, exposed to the device. In assessing the degree of danger, the Commissioner need not find that the danger is immediate, and it shall be sufficient for the Commissioner to determine that the danger may involve a serious long-term risk. 
</P>
<P>(c) If the Commissioner makes a proposed regulation effective in accordance with this section, the Commissioner will, as expeditiously as possible, give interested persons prompt notice of this action in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and will provide an opportunity for an informal hearing in accordance with part 16 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(d) After the hearing, if any, and after considering any written comments submitted on the proposal and any additional available information and data, the Commissioner will as expeditiously as possible either affirm, modify, or revoke the proposed regulation making the device a banned device. If the Commissioner decides to affirm or modify the proposed regulation to make a device a banned device, the Commissioner will amend subpart B by adding the name or description of the device, or both, to the list of banned devices. If the Commissioner decides to revoke a proposed regulation making a device a banned device, a notice of termination of rulemaking proceedings and reasons therefor will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> 
</P>
<P>(e) The Commissioner may declare the special effective date provided by this section to be in effect after the publication of a proposed regulation under § 895.21(d), if, based on new information, or upon reconsideration of previously available information, the Commissioner makes the determination and provides the appropriate notices and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section. 
</P>
<P>(f) Those devices that have been named banned devices under § 895.30 and that have already been sold to the public may be subject to relabeling by the manufacturer, distributor, importer, or any other person(s) responsible for the labeling of the device or may be subject to the provisions of section 518(a) or (b) of the act.

<HEAD>§ 900.11   Requirements for certification.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> After October 1, 1994, a certificate issued by FDA is required for lawful operation of all mammography facilities subject to the provisions of this subpart. To obtain a certificate from FDA, facilities are required to meet the quality standards in § 900.12 and to be accredited by an approved accreditation body or other entity as designated by FDA.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Application</I>—(1) <I>Certificates.</I> (i) In order to qualify for a certificate, a facility must apply to an FDA-approved accreditation body, or to another entity designated by FDA. The facility shall submit to such body or entity the information required in 42 U.S.C. 263b(d)(1).
</P>
<P>(ii) Following the agency's receipt of the accreditation body's decision to accredit a facility, or an equivalent decision by another entity designated by FDA, the agency may issue a certificate to the facility, or renew an existing certificate, if the agency determines that the facility has satisfied the requirements for certification or recertification.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Provisional certificates.</I> (i) A new facility beginning operation after October 1, 1994, is eligible to apply for a provisional certificate. The provisional certificate will enable the facility to perform mammography and to obtain the clinical images needed to complete the accreditation process. To apply for and receive a provisional certificate, a facility must meet the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 263b(c)(4) and submit the necessary information to an approved accreditation body or other entity designated by FDA.
</P>
<P>(ii) Following the agency's receipt of the accreditation body's decision that a facility has submitted the required information, FDA may issue a provisional certificate to a facility upon determination that the facility has satisfied the requirements of § 900.11(b)(2)(i). A provisional certificate shall be effective for up to 6 months from the date of issuance. A provisional certificate cannot be renewed, but a facility may apply for a 90-day extension of the provisional certificate.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Extension of provisional certificate.</I> (i) To apply for a 90-day extension to a provisional certificate, a facility shall submit to its accreditation body, or other entity designated by FDA, a statement of what the facility is doing to obtain certification and evidence that there would be a significant adverse impact on access to mammography in the geographic area served if such facility did not obtain an extension.
</P>
<P>(ii) The accreditation body shall forward the request, with its recommendation, to FDA within 2 business days after receipt.
</P>
<P>(iii) FDA may issue a 90-day extension for a provisional certificate upon determination that the extension meets the criteria set forth in 42 U.S.C. 263b(c)(2).
</P>
<P>(iv) There can be no renewal of a provisional certificate beyond the 90-day extension.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Reinstatement policy.</I> A previously certified facility that has allowed its certificate to expire, that has been refused a renewal of its certificate by FDA, or that has had its certificate suspended or revoked by FDA, may apply to have the certificate reinstated so that the facility may be considered to be a new facility and thereby be eligible for a provisional certificate.
</P>
<P>(1) Unless prohibited from reinstatement under § 900.11(c)(4), a facility applying for reinstatement shall:
</P>
<P>(i) Contact an FDA-approved accreditation body or other entity designated by FDA to determine the requirements for reapplication for accreditation;
</P>
<P>(ii) Fully document its history as a previously provisionally certified or certified mammography facility, including the following information:
</P>
<P>(A) Name and address of the facility under which it was previously provisionally certified or certified;
</P>
<P>(B) Name of previous owner/lessor;
</P>
<P>(C) FDA facility identification number assigned to the facility under its previous certification; and
</P>
<P>(D) Expiration date of the most recent FDA provisional certificate or certificate; and
</P>
<P>(iii) Justify application for reinstatement of accreditation by submitting to the accreditation body or other entity designated by FDA, a corrective action plan that details how the facility has corrected deficiencies that contributed to the lapse of, denial of renewal, or revocation of its certificate.
</P>
<P>(2) FDA may issue a provisional certificate to the facility if:
</P>
<P>(i) The accreditation body or other entity designated by FDA notifies the agency that the facility has adequately corrected, or is in the process of correcting, pertinent deficiencies; and
</P>
<P>(ii) FDA determines that the facility has taken sufficient corrective action since the lapse of, denial of renewal, or revocation of its previous certificate.
</P>
<P>(3) After receiving the provisional certificate, the facility may lawfully resume performing mammography services while completing the requirements for certification.
</P>
<P>(4) If a facility's certificate was revoked on the basis of an act described in 42 U.S.C. 263b(i)(1), as implemented by § 900.14(a), no person who owned or operated that facility at the time the act occurred may own or operate a mammography facility within 2 years of the date of revocation.

</P>
<P>(iv) If the mammography report identifies the breast density as “The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses” or “The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography,” the lay summary shall include the statement “Breast tissue can be either dense or not dense. Dense tissue makes it harder to find breast cancer on a mammogram and also raises the risk of developing breast cancer. Your breast tissue is dense. In some people with dense tissue, other imaging tests in addition to a mammogram may help find cancers. Talk to your healthcare provider about breast density, risks for breast cancer, and your individual situation.”


</P>
