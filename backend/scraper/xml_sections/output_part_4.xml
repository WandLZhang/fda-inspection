<P>(a) All time limitations prescribed pursuant to this section shall begin as of the time at which a request for records is logged in by the Division of Freedom of Information pursuant to § 20.40(c). An oral request for records shall not begin any time requirement. A written request for records sent elsewhere within the agency shall not begin any time requirement until it is redirected to the Division of Freedom of Information and is logged in there in accordance with § 20.40(c).
</P>
<P>(b) Within 20 working days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after a request for records is logged in at the Division of Freedom of Information, the agency shall send a letter to the requester providing the agency's determination as to whether, or the extent to which, the agency will comply with the request, and, if any records are denied, the reasons for the denial.
</P>
<P>(1) If all of the records requested have been located and a final determination has been made with respect to disclosure of all of the records requested, the letter shall so state.
</P>
<P>(2) If all of the records have not been located or a final determination has not yet been made with respect to disclosure of all of the records requested, e.g., because it is necessary to consult the person affected pursuant to § 20.47, the letter shall state the extent to which the records involved shall be disclosed pursuant to the rules established in this part. 
</P>
<P>(3)(i) In unusual circumstances, the agency may extend the time for sending the letter for an additional period.
</P>
<P>(A) The Agency may provide for an extension of up to 10 working days by providing written notice to the requester setting out the reasons for the extension and the date by which a determination is expected to be sent. In the written notice, the Agency will inform the requester of the right to contact the Freedom of Information Act Public Liaison and to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.
</P>
<P>(B) The agency may provide for an extension of more than 10 working days by providing written notice to the requester setting out the reasons for the extension. The notice also will give the requester an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed in a shorter time and/or an opportunity to agree on a timeframe longer than the 10 extra working days for processing the request.
</P>
<P>(ii) Unusual circumstances may exist under any of the following conditions:
</P>
<P>(A) There is a need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other components that are separate from the agency component responsible for processing the request;
</P>
<P>(B) There is a need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request; or
</P>
<P>(C) There is need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or among two or more components of the Food and Drug Administration having substantial subject-matter interest in the determination.
</P>
<P>(4) The Agency may contact the requester for clarification about the request or regarding fee assessment. The Agency may toll the 20-day period as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) One time while it is awaiting a response from the requester regarding clarification that it has reasonably requested from the requester; and
</P>
<P>(ii) One or more times while the Agency is awaiting a response from the requester regarding fee assessment.

<HEAD>§ 20.44   Expedited processing.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Food and Drug Administration will provide expedited processing of a request for records when the requester demonstrates a compelling need, or in other cases as determined by the agency. A compelling need exists when:
</P>
<P>(1) A failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or
</P>
<P>(2) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, there is a demonstrated urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.
</P>
<P>(b) A request for expedited processing made under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be made by the specific individual who is subject to an imminent threat, or by a family member, medical or health care professional, or other authorized representative of the individual, and must demonstrate a reasonable basis for concluding that failure to obtain the requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose a specific and identifiable imminent threat to the life or safety of the individual.
</P>
<P>(c) A request for expedited processing made under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must demonstrate that:
</P>
<P>(1) The requester is primarily engaged in disseminating information to the general public and not merely to a narrow interest group;
</P>
<P>(2) There is an urgent need for the requested information and that it has a particular value that will be lost if not obtained and disseminated quickly; however, a news media publication or broadcast deadline alone does not qualify as an urgent need, nor does a request for historical information; and

<HEAD>§ 20.45   Fees to be charged.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Categories of requests.</I> Paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section state, for each category of request, the type of fees that the Food and Drug Administration will generally charge. However, for each of these categories, the fees may be limited, waived, or reduced for the reasons given in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and in § 20.46 or for other reasons.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Commercial use request.</I> If the request is for a commercial use, the Food and Drug Administration will charge for the costs of search, review, and duplication. The Agency shall not assess search fees if the Agency fails to comply with any time limit, as described in § 20.41, if no unusual or exceptional circumstances apply to the processing of the request. If unusual circumstances, as outlined in § 20.41, apply and more than 5,000 pages are responsive to the request, the Food and Drug Administration may charge search fees if timely written notice has been made to the requester and the Agency has discussed with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Educational and scientific institutions and news media.</I> If the request is from an educational institution or a noncommercial scientific institution, operated primarily for scholarly or scientific research, or a representative of the news media, and the request is not for a commercial use, the Food and Drug Administration will charge only for the duplication of documents. Also, the Food and Drug Administration will not charge the copying costs for the first 100 pages of duplication (or its cost equivalent of other media). The Agency shall not assess duplication fees if the Agency fails to comply with any time limit, as described in § 20.41, if no unusual or exceptional circumstances apply to the processing of the request. If unusual circumstances, as outlined in § 20.41, apply and more than 5,000 pages are responsive to the request, the Food and Drug Administration may charge duplication fees if timely written notice has been made to the requester and the Agency has discussed with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Other requests.</I> If the request is not the kind described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, then the Food and Drug Administration will charge only for the search and the duplication. Also, the Food and Drug Administration will not charge for the first 2 hours of search time or for the copying costs of the first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent of other media). The Agency shall not assess search or duplication fees if the Agency fails to comply with any time limit, as described in § 20.41, if no unusual or exceptional circumstances apply to the processing of the request. If unusual circumstances, as outlined in § 20.41, apply and more than 5,000 pages are responsive to the request, the Food and Drug Administration may charge search or duplication fees if timely written notice has been made to the requester and the Agency has discussed with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>General provisions.</I> (1) The Food and Drug Administration may charge search fees even if the records found are exempt from disclosure or if no records are found.
</P>
<P>(2) If, under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, there is no charge for the first 2 hours of search time, and those 2 hours are spent on a computer search, then the 2 free hours are the first 2 hours of the operator's own operation. If the operator spends less than 2 hours on the search, the total search fees will be reduced by the average hourly rate for the operator's time, multiplied by 2.
</P>
<P>(3) If, under paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, there is no charge for the first 100 pages of duplication, then those 100 pages are the first 100 pages of photocopies of standard size pages, or the first 100 pages of computer printout. If this method to calculate the fee reduction cannot be used, then the total duplication fee will be reduced by the normal charge for photocopying a standard size page, multiplied by 100.
</P>
<P>(4) No charge will be made if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee.
</P>
<P>(5) If it is determined that a requester (acting either alone or together with others) is breaking down a single request into a series of requests in order to avoid (or reduce) the fees charged, all these requests may be aggregated for purposes of calculating the fees charged.
</P>
<P>(6) Interest will be charged on unpaid bills beginning on the 31st day following the day the bill was sent. Provisions in 45 CFR part 30, the Department of Health and Human Services regulations governing claims collection, will be used in assessing interest, administrative costs, and penalties, and in taking actions to encourage payment.
</P>
<P>(7) Requesters may contact Agency Freedom of Information Act staff or the Freedom of Information Act Public Liaison to assist in reformulating a request to meet their needs at lower cost.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Fee schedule.</I> The Food and Drug Administration charges the following fees in accordance with the regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services at 45 CFR part 5.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Manual searching for or reviewing of records.</I> When the search or review is performed by employees at grade GS-1 through GS-8 (or equivalent), an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-5, step 7, employee; when done by a GS-9 through GS-14 (or equivalent), an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-12, step 4, employee; and when done by a GS-15 or above (or equivalent), an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-15, step 7, employee. In each case, the hourly rate will be computed by taking the current hourly rate for the specified grade and step in the General Schedule Locality Pay Table for the Locality of Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA, adding 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits, and rounding to the nearest whole dollar. When a search involves employees at more than one of these levels, the Food and Drug Administration will charge the rate appropriate for each.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Electronic searching.</I> Charges for the time spent by the operator to search the computer, database, or network, including development of any specialized programming required to perform the search, at the rate given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section plus the cost of any materials.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Photocopying standard size pages.</I> $0.10 per page. Freedom of Information Officers may charge lower fees for particular documents where:
</P>
<P>(i) The document has already been printed in large numbers;
</P>
<P>(ii) The program office determines that using existing stock to answer this request, and any other anticipated Freedom of Information requests, will not interfere with program requirements; and
</P>
<P>(iii) The Freedom of Information Officer determines that the lower fee is adequate to recover the prorated share of the original printing costs.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Photocopying odd-size documents (such as punchcards or blueprints), or reproducing other records (such as tapes).</I> The actual costs of operating the machine, plus the actual cost of the materials used, plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Certifying that records are true copies.</I> This service is not required by the Freedom of Information Act. If the Food and Drug Administration agrees to provide certification, there is a $10 charge per certification.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Sending records by express mail or other special methods.</I> This service is not required by the Freedom of Information Act. If the Food and Drug Administration agrees to provide this service, the requester will be required to directly pay, or be directly charged by, the courier. The agency will not agree to any special delivery method that does not permit the requester to directly pay or be directly charged for the service.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Performing any other special service in connection with a request to which the Food and Drug Administration has agreed.</I> Actual costs of operating any machinery, plus actual cost of any materials used, plus charges for the time of the Food and Drug Administration's employees, at the rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Procedures for assessing and collecting fees</I>—(1) <I>Agreement to pay.</I> The Food and Drug Administration generally assumes that a requester is willing to pay the fees charged for services associated with the request. The requester may specify a limit on the amount to be spent. If it appears that the fees will exceed the limit, the Food and Drug Administration will consult the requester to determine whether to proceed with the search.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Advance payment.</I> If a requester has failed to pay previous bills in a timely fashion, or if the Food and Drug Administration's initial review of the request indicates that the charges will exceed $250, the requester will be required to pay past due fees and/or the estimated fees, or a deposit, before the search for the requested records begins. In such cases, the requester will be notified promptly upon receipt of the request, and the administrative time limits prescribed in § 20.41 will begin only after there is an agreement with the requester over payment of fees, or a decision that fee waiver or reduction is appropriate.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Billing and payment.</I> Ordinarily, the requester will be required to pay all fees before the Food and Drug Administration will furnish the records. At its discretion, the Food and Drug Administration may send the requester a bill along with or following the records. For example, the Food and Drug Administration may do this if the requester has a history of prompt payment. The Food and Drug Administration may also, at its discretion, aggregate the charges for certain time periods in order to avoid sending numerous small bills to frequent requesters, or to businesses or agents representing requesters. For example, the Food and Drug Administration might send a bill to such a requester once a month. Fees should be paid in accordance with the instructions furnished by the person who responds to the request.

<HEAD>§ 20.46   Waiver or reduction of fees.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Standard.</I> The Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs (or delegatee) will waive or reduce the fees that would otherwise be charged if disclosure of the information meets both of the following tests:
</P>
<P>(1) Is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government; and
</P>
<P>(2) It is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. These two tests are explained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Public interest.</I> Disclosure of information satisfies the first test only if it furthers the specific public interest of being likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of Government operations or activities, regardless of any other public interest it may further. In analyzing this question, the Food and Drug Administration will consider the following factors:
</P>
<P>(1) Whether the records to be disclosed pertain to the operations or activities of the Federal Government;
</P>
<P>(2) Whether disclosure of the records would reveal any meaningful information about Government operations or activities that is not already public knowledge;
</P>
<P>(3) Whether disclosure will advance the understanding of the general public as distinguished from a narrow segment of interested persons. Under this factor, the Food and Drug Administration may consider whether the requester is in a position to contribute to public understanding. For example, the Food and Drug Administration may consider whether the requester has such knowledge or expertise as may be necessary to understand the information, and whether the requester's intended use of the information would be likely to disseminate the information to the public. An unsupported claim to be doing research for a book or article does not demonstrate that likelihood, while such a claim by a representative of the news media is better evidence; and
</P>
<P>(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding will be a significant one, i.e., will the public's understanding of the Government's operations be substantially greater as a result of the disclosure.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Not primarily in the requester's commercial interest.</I> If disclosure passes the test of furthering the specific public interest described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Food and Drug Administration will determine whether disclosure also furthers the requester's commercial interest and, if so, whether this effect outweighs the advancement of that public interest. In applying this second test, the Food and Drug Administration will consider the following factors:
</P>
<P>(1) Whether disclosure would further a commercial interest of the requester, or of someone on whose behalf the requester is acting. Commercial interests include interests relating to business, trade, and profit. Both profit and nonprofit-making corporations have commercial interests, as well as individuals, unions, and other associations. The interest of a representative of the news media in using the information for news dissemination purposes will not be considered a commercial interest.
</P>
<P>(2) If disclosure would further a commercial interest of the requester, whether that effect outweighs the advancement of the public interest as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Deciding between waiver and reduction.</I> If the disclosure of the information requested passes both tests described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Food and Drug Administration will normally waive fees. However, in some cases the Food and Drug Administration may decide only to reduce the fees. For example, the Food and Drug Administration may do this when disclosure of some but not all of the requested records passes the tests.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Procedure for requesting a waiver or reduction.</I> A requester must request a waiver or reduction of fees at the same time as the request for records. The requester should explain why a waiver or reduction is proper under the factors set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. Only the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs may make the decision whether to waive or reduce the fees. If the Food and Drug Administration does not completely grant the request for a waiver or reduction, the denial letter will designate a review official. The requester may appeal the denial to that official. The appeal letter should address reasons for the Associate Commissioner's decision that are set forth in the denial letter.

<HEAD>§ 20.60   Applicability of exemptions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The exemptions established in this subpart shall apply to all Food and Drug Administration records, except as provided in subpart E of this part. Accordingly, a record that is ordinarily available for public disclosure in accordance with the provisions in subpart F of this part or of another regulation cross-referenced in § 20.100(c) is not available for such disclosure to the extent that it falls within an exemption contained in this subpart, except as provided by the limitations on exemptions specified in subpart E of this part. For example, correspondence that is ordinarily disclosable under § 20.103 is not disclosable to the extent that it contains trade secrets exempt from disclosure under § 20.61 and is not subject to discretionary release under § 20.82.
</P>
<P>(b) Where application of one or more exemptions results in a record being disclosable in part and nondisclosable in part, the rule established in § 20.22 shall apply.

</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="20.61" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="1">
<HEAD>§ 20.61   Trade secrets and commercial or financial information which is privileged or confidential.</HEAD>
<P>(a) A trade secret may consist of any commercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making, preparing, compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can be said to be the end product of either innovation or substantial effort. There must be a direct relationship between the trade secret and the productive process.
</P>
<P>(b) Commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential means valuable data or information which is used in one's business and is of a type customarily held in strict confidence or regarded as privileged and not disclosed to any member of the public by the person to whom it belongs.
</P>
<P>(c) Data and information submitted or divulged to the Food and Drug Administration which fall within the definitions of a trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information are not available for public disclosure.
</P>
<P>(d) A person who submits records to the Government may designate part or all of the information in such records as exempt from disclosure under exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act. The person may make this designation either at the time the records are submitted to the Government or within a reasonable time thereafter. The designation must be in writing. Where a legend is required by a request for proposals or request for quotations, pursuant to 48 CFR 352.215-12, then that legend is necessary for this purpose. Any such designation will expire 10 years after the records were submitted to the Government.
</P>
<P>(e) The procedures in this paragraph apply to records on which the submitter has designated information as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. These procedures also apply to records that were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration when the agency has substantial reason to believe that information in the records could reasonably be considered exempt under exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act. Certain exceptions to these procedures are set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.
</P>
<P>(1) When the Food and Drug Administration receives a request for such records and determines that disclosure may be required, the Food and Drug Administration will make reasonable efforts to notify the submitter about these facts. The notice will include a copy of the request, and it will inform the submitter about the procedures and time limits for submission and consideration of objections to disclosure. If the Food and Drug Administration must notify a large number of submitters, notification may be done by posting or publishing a notice in a place where the submitters are reasonably likely to become aware of it.
</P>
<P>(2) The submitter has 10 working days from the date of the notice to object to disclosure of any part of the records and to state all bases for its objections. The Division of Freedom of Information may extend this period as appropriate and necessary.
</P>
<P>(3) The Food and Drug Administration will give consideration to all bases that have been stated in a timely manner by the submitter. If the Food and Drug Administration decides to disclose the records, the Food and Drug Administration will notify the submitter in writing. This notice will briefly explain why the agency did not sustain the submitter's objections. The Food and Drug Administration will include with the notice a copy of the records about which the submitter objected, as the agency proposes to disclose them. The notice will state that the Food and Drug Administration intends to disclose the records 5 working days after the submitter receives the notice unless a U.S. District Court orders the agency not to release them.
</P>
<P>(4) If a requester files suit under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain records covered by this paragraph, the Food and Drug Administration will promptly notify the submitter.
</P>
<P>(5) Whenever the Food and Drug Administration sends a notice to a submitter under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Food and Drug Administration will notify the requester that the Food and Drug Administration is giving the submitter a notice and an opportunity to object. Whenever the Food and Drug Administration sends a notice to a submitter under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the Food and Drug Administration will notify the requester of this fact.
</P>
<P>(f) The notice requirements in paragraph (e) of this section do not apply in the following situations:
</P>
<P>(1) The Food and Drug Administration decided not to disclose the records;
</P>
<P>(2) The information has previously been published or made generally available;
</P>
<P>(3) Disclosure is required by a regulation issued after notice and opportunity for public comment, that specifies narrow categories of records that are to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, but in this case a submitter may still designate records as described in paragraph (d) of this section, and in exceptional cases, the Food and Drug Administration may, at its discretion, follow the notice procedures in paragraph (e) of this section;
</P>
<P>(4) The information requested has not been designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure when the submitter had an opportunity to do so at the time of submission of the information or within a reasonable time thereafter, unless the Food and Drug Administration has substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would result in competitive harm; or
</P>
<P>(5) The designation appears to be obviously frivolous, but in this case the Food and Drug Administration will still give the submitter the written notice required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section (although this notice need not explain our decision or include a copy of the records), and the Food and Drug Administration will notify the requester as described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.

Employees of regulated business enterprises are considered individuals. Accordingly, physicians and other health professionals who are engaged in business as proprietors of establishments regulated by the Food and Drug Administration are not considered individuals; however, physicians and other health professionals who are engaged in clinical investigations, employed by regulated enterprises, or the subjects of records concerning their own health, e.g., exposure to excessive radiation, are considered individuals.

<HEAD>§ 21.30   Records of contractors.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Systems of records that are required to be operated, or as a matter of practical necessity must be operated, by contractors to accomplish Food and Drug Administration functions, from which information is retrieved by individual names or other personal identifiers, may be subject to the provisions of this part. If the contract is agreed to on or after September 27, 1975, the criminal penalties set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(i) are applicable to such contractor, and any employee of such contractor, for disclosures prohibited in § 21.71 or for maintenance of a system of records without notice as required in § 21.20.
</P>
<P>(b) A contract is considered to accomplish a Food and Drug Administration function if the proposal or activity it supports is principally operated on behalf of and is under the direct management of the Food and Drug Administration. Systems of records from which information is retrieved by individual names or other personal identifiers and that are operated under contracts to accomplish Food and Drug Administration functions are deemed to be maintained by the agency and shall be subject to the procedures and requirements of this part.
</P>
<P>(c) A contract is not considered to accomplish a Food and Drug Administration function if the program or activity it supports is not principally operated on behalf of, or is not under the direct management of, the Food and Drug Administration. For example, this part does not apply to systems of records:
</P>
<P>(1) Operated under contract with the Food and Drug Administration by State or local government agencies, or organizations representing such agencies, when such agencies or organizations are also performing State or local government functions.
</P>
<P>(2) Operated by contractors with the Food and Drug Administration by individuals or organizations whose primary function is delivery of health services, such as hospitals, physicians, pharmacists, and other health professionals, and that report information concerning products, e.g., injuries or product defects, to the Food and Drug Administration. Before such contractors submit information to the Food and Drug Administration, the names and other personal identifiers of patients or research subjects in any medical or similar report, test, study, or other research project shall be deleted, unless the contract provides otherwise. If the Food and Drug Administration subsequently needs the names of such individuals, a separate request will be made.
</P>
<P>(3) Relating to individuals whom the contractor employs, or with whom the contractor otherwise deals, in the course of providing goods and services to the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>(4) Operated under grants.
</P>
<P>(d) The requirements of this part shall apply when a contractor who operates a system of records not subject to this part reports to the Food and Drug Administration information that is a system of records about individuals from which personal information is retrieved by names or other personal identifiers. Where the information would be a new Privacy Act Record System, or a change in an existing Privacy Act Record System of a type described in § 21.21, the Food and Drug Administration shall comply with the requirements of § 21.21.
</P>
<P>(e) The Food and Drug Administration will review all contracts before award to determine whether operation of a system from which information is retrieved by individual names or other personal identifiers will be required of the contractor, by the terms of the contract or as a matter of practical necessity. If such operation will be required, the solicitation and contract shall include the following clause, or a clause of similar effect:
</P>
<EXTRACT>
<P>Whenever the contractor or any of his employees is required by this contract to operate a system of records from which information is retrieved by individual names or other personal identifiers in order to accomplish a Food and Drug Administration function, the contractor and every employee is considered to be an employee of the Food and Drug Administration and shall operate such system of records in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), regulations of the Food and Drug Administration in 21 CFR part 21, and rules of conduct that apply to Food and Drug Administration employees who work with such systems of records. The contractor and his employees are subject to the criminal penalties set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(i) for violations of the Privacy Act.</P></EXTRACT>

<P>(a) Present and former Food and Drug Administration employees desiring access to personnel records about themselves should consult system notices applicable to the agency's personnel records that are published by the Office of Personnel Management and the Department as well as any notice issued by the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>(b)(1) The procedures of the Office of Personnel Management at 5 CFR parts 293, 294, and 297 rather than the procedures in § 21.33 and subparts D through F of this part, govern systems of personnel records about Food and Drug Administration employees that are subject to notice published by the Office of Personnel Management, i.e., systems that:
</P>
<P>(i) The Office of Personnel Management maintains.
</P>
<P>(ii) Are maintained by the Division of Human Resources Management, Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>(iii) Are maintained by Department Regional Offices, concerning field employees.
</P>
<P>(2) The Office of Personnel Management's procedures may, if necessary, be supplemented in the Food and Drug Administration Staff Manual Guide. Current Food and Drug Administration employees should mail or deliver written requests under the Privacy Act for access to personnel records described in this paragraph to the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with 5 CFR 297.106, the Director, Division of Human Resources Management HR-BETHPL RM7114, HFA-705, 7700 Wisconsin Ave., 7th &amp; 8th floors, Bethesda, MD 20814, or the personnel officer in the servicing HHS Regional Personnel Office. An employee may consult with or direct his or her request to the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator (the Privacy Act Coordinator is part of the Freedom of Information Staff, the address for which is located on the Agency Web site at <I>http://www.fda.gov</I>). Requests for access to personnel records of former employees that are located in Federal Records Centers should be directed to the Office of Personnel Management. Requests under the Privacy Act for amendment of personnel records should be directed to these same officials who are responsible for access to personnel records under this paragraph.
</P>
<P>(3) With respect to records subject to paragraph (b)(1) of this section:
</P>
<P>(i) Refusal to grant access to a record, or refusal to amend a record upon request of an employee, shall only be made by the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations or his or her designate; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Appeals of refusals under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section may be made to the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with 5 CFR 297.108(g)(3) and 297.113(b).
</P>
<P>(c) Any other Privacy Act Record Systems that contain personnel records, or records that otherwise concern agency employees, that are maintained by offices of the Food and Drug Administration rather than the Division of Human Resources Management but which are not subject to the Department's notice for personnel records in operating offices are subject to this part, except that refusals under this part to grant access to or amend records about present or former employees shall be made by the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations rather than the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>(d) The following procedures shall govern requests under the Privacy Act for personnel records that are maintained by the operating offices of the Food and Drug Administration in which employees work:
</P>
<P>(1) An employee shall upon request be told whether records about him are maintained. An employee shall be given access to records about himself that are subject to this paragraph in response to an oral or written request and through informal procedures, rather than the procedures specified in §§ 21.40 through 21.43.
</P>
<P>(2) Employee identity may be verified, if necessary, by an FDA ID card rather than in accordance with § 21.44.
</P>
<P>(3) Generally no fee shall be charged for records requested under this paragraph. However, in cases where the records requested are voluminous, a fee may be charged in accordance with § 21.45.
</P>
<P>(4) Records that are subject to this paragraph shall be available for access to an individual, except to the extent that access is refused by the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations or his or her designate on the grounds that the record is subject to an exemption under § 21.61 or 5 CFR 297.111.
</P>
<P>(5) Requests under the Privacy Act for amendment of records subject to this paragraph should be directed to the Director, Division of Human Resources Management (HFA-400). Such requests shall be reviewed in accordance with subpart E of this part. Refusal to amend a record subject to this paragraph (d)(5) shall only be made by the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations or his or her designate.
</P>
<P>(6) Appeals of refusals under paragraph (d) (4) or (5) of this section may be made to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, except where the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations or his or her designate indicates with his or her refusal that the appeal should be made to the Office of Personnel Management.

<P>(a) In general, an individual is entitled to have access to any medical records about himself in Privacy Act Record Systems maintained by the Food and Drug Administration.

</P>
<P>(1) The agency may review the records to determine whether disclosure of the record to the individual who is the subject of the records might have an adverse effect on him. If it is determined that disclosure is not likely to have an adverse effect on the individual, the record shall be disclosed to him. If it is determined that disclosure is very likely to have an adverse effect on the individual, he may be requested to designate, in writing, a representative to whom the record shall be disclosed. Such representative may be a physician, other health professional, or other responsible person who would be willing to review the record and discuss it with the individual.
</P>
<P>(2) The availability of the record may be subject to any procedures for disclosure to an individual of medical records about himself under part 20 of this chapter, in addition to or in lieu of the procedures in paragraph (b)(1), that are not inconsistent with § 21.41(f).

<DIV8 N="21.40" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="1">
<HEAD>§ 21.40   Procedures for submitting requests for notification and access.</HEAD>
<P>(a) An individual may request that the Food and Drug Administration notify him whether a Privacy Act Record System contains records about him that are retrieved by reference to his name or other personal identifier. An individual may at the same time, or after receiving notification that such a record about him exists, requests that he be given access to the record.
</P>
<P>(b) An individual desiring notification or access to records shall mail or deliver a request for records in any Food and Drug Administration Privacy Act Records System to the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator (address is located on the agency web site at <I>http://www.gov.fda</I>).
</P>
<P>(c) Requests shall be in writing and shall name the Privacy Act Record System or Systems concerning which the individual requests notification of whether there are records about him that are retrieved by reference to his name or other personal identifier. To help assure a prompt response, an individual should indicate that he is making a “Privacy Act Request” on the envelope and in a prominent manner in the letter.
</P>
<P>(d) An individual who merely wishes to be notified whether a Privacy Act Record System contains a record about him ordinarily need not provide any verification of his identity other than his name. The mere fact that the Food and Drug Administration has a record about an individual in any of its Privacy Act Records Systems would not be likely to constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Where mere disclosure of the fact that a record about the individual exists would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, further verification of the identity of the individual shall be required.
</P>
<P>(e) An individual who requests that he be given access to a copy of records about himself, if any exist, should indicate whether he prefers (1) to have copies of any such records mailed to him in accordance with § 21.43(a)(1), which may involve a fee under § 21.45, including information to verify his identity under § 21.44 or (2) to use the procedures for access in person under § 21.43(a)(2).
</P>
<P>(f) A request for notification and access may be submitted under this subpart concerning any Privacy Act Record System that is exempt under § 21.61, as indicated in the notice for the system. An individual seeking access to records under § 21.65(b)(2) to investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes other than criminal law enforcement purposes should submit a description of the right, benefit, or privilege that he believes he was denied as the result of the Food and Drug Administration's maintenance of the records. Where the system is exempt under § 21.61, and access to the requested records is not granted under § 21.65, the request shall be handled under the provisions of part 20 of this chapter (the public information regulations).

</P>
<P>(b) The Food and Drug Administration will determine whether a request by an individual for records about himself is appropriately treated as a request under this subpart, or under the provision of part 20 of this chapter (the public information regulations), or both. Where appropriate, the Food and Drug Administration will consult with the individual concerning the appropriate treatment of the request.
</P>
<P>(c) The FDA Privacy Act Coordinator in the Division of Freedom of Information (address is located on the agency web site at <I>http://www.gov.fda</I>) shall be responsible for the handling of Privacy Act requests received by the Food and Drug Administration. Requests mailed or delivered to any other office shall be promptly redirected to the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator. Where this procedure would unduly delay the agency's response, however, the agency employee who received the request should consult with the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator and obtain advice as to whether the employee can respond to the request directly.
</P>
<P>(d) Upon receipt of a request by the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator, a record shall promptly be made that a request has been received and the date.
</P>
<P>(e) A letter in accordance with § 21.42 responding to the request for notification shall issue as promptly as possible after receipt of the request by the Food and Drug Administration. Upon determination by the Division of Freedom of Information  (address is located on the agency web site at <I>http://www.gov.fda</I>) that a request for access to records is appropriately treated as a request under part 20 of this chapter rather than part 21, or under both parts, the time limitations prescribed in § 21.41 shall apply. In any case, access to available records shall be provided as promptly as possible.

An individual shall not be denied access to any record that is otherwise available to him/her under this part except on the grounds that it is exempt under § 21.65(a)(2), that it was compiled in reasonable anticipation of court litigation of formal administrative proceedings, or to the extent that it is exempt or prohibited from disclosure because it includes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential information the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of another individual.
</P>
<P>(g) The FDA Privacy Act Coordinator shall ensure that records are maintained of the number, status, and disposition of requests under this subpart, including the number of requests for records exempt from access under this subpart and other information required for purposes of the annual report to Congress under the Privacy Act. These temporary administrative management records shall not be considered to be Privacy Act Record Systems. All records required to be kept under this paragraph shall only include requesting individuals' names or personal identifiers for so long as any request for notification, access, or amendment is pending. The identity of individuals making request under this subpart shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be disclosed under part 20 of this chapter (the public information regulations) to any other person or agency except as is necessary for the processing of requests under this subpart.

<P>(a) The FDA shall respond to an individual's request for notification as to whether a Privacy Act Record System contains records about him that are retrieved by his name or other personal identifier by sending a letter under this paragraph.
</P>
<P>(1) If there are no records about the individual that are retrieved by his name or other personal identifier in the named Privacy Act Record System, or the requester is not an “individual” under § 21.3(a), the letter shall so state. Where appropriate, the letter shall indicate that the Food and Drug Administration's public information regulations in part 20 of this chapter prescribe general rules governing the availability of information to members of the public, and that a request may be made in accordance with part 20 of this chapter for records that are not retrieved by the requester's name or other personal identifier from a Privacy Act Record System.
</P>
<P>(2) If there are records about the individual that are retrieved by his name or other personal identifier and the named Privacy Act Record System is not exempt from individual access and contest under § 21.61, or the system is exempt but access is allowed or required under § 21.65, the letter shall inform him that the records exist and shall either:
</P>
<P>(i) Enclose a copy of the records under § 21.43(a)(1) or indicate that the records will be sent under separate cover, where there has been adequate verification of the identity of the individual under § 21.44 and the fees under § 21.45 do not exceed $25, or
</P>
<P>(ii) Inform the individual of the procedures to obtain access to the records by mail or in person under § 21.43(a)(2), as well as the approximate dates by which the requested records can be provided (if the records are not then available), the locations at which access in person may be had, and the information needed, if any, to verify the identity of the individual under § 21.44.
</P>
<P>(3) If the named Privacy Act Record System contains records about the individual that are retrieved by his name or other personal identifier, and the system is exempt from individual access and contest under § 21.61 and access is not allowed or required under § 21.65, the letter should inform him that the records are exempted from access and contest by § 21.61. The letter shall also inform him if the records sought are not available because they were compiled in reasonable anticipation of court litigation or formal administrative proceedings or are otherwise not available under § 21.41(b). Where appropriate, the letter shall also indicate whether the records are available under part 20 of this chapter (the public information regulations), and it may disclose the records in accordance with part 20.
</P>
<P>(4) If the named Privacy Act Record System contains records about the individual that are retrieved by his name or other personal identifier, but a final determination has not yet been made with respect to disclosure of all of the records covered by the request, e.g., because it is necessary to consult another person or agency having an interest in the confidentiality of the records, the letter shall explain the circumstances and indicate when a final answer will be given.
</P>
<P>(b) Except as provided in § 21.32, access to a record may only be denied by the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs or his or her designate. If access to any record is denied wholly or in substantial part, the letter shall state the right of the individual to appeal to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.
</P>
<P>(c) If a request for a copy of the records will result in a fee of more than $25, the letter shall specify or estimate the fee involved. Where the individual has requested a copy of any records about him and copying the records would result in a fee of over $50, the Food and Drug Administration shall require advance deposit as well as payment of any amount not yet received as a result of any previous request by the individual for a record about himself, under this subpart or part 20 of this chapter (the public information regulations) before the records are made available. If the fee is less than $50, prepayment shall not be required unless payment has not yet been received for records disclosed as a result of a previous request by the individual for a record about himself under this subpart or part 20 of this chapter.

<HEAD>§ 21.50   Procedures for submitting requests for amendment of records.</HEAD>
<P>(a) An individual who received access to a record about himself under subpart D of this part may request that the record be amended if he believes that the record or an item of information is not accurate, relevant to a Food and Drug Administration purpose, timely, or complete.
</P>
<P>(b) Amendments under this subpart shall not violate existing statute, regulation, or administrative procedure.
</P>
<P>(1) This subpart does not permit alteration of evidence presented in the course of judicial proceedings or Food and Drug Administration adjudicatory or rule making proceedings or collateral attack upon that which has already been the subject of any such proceedings.
</P>
<P>(2) If the accuracy, relevancy, timeliness, or completeness of the records may be contested in any other pending or imminent agency proceeding, the Food and Drug Administration may refer the individual to the other proceeding as the appropriate means to obtain relief. If the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of a record is, or has been, an issue in another agency proceeding, the request under this section shall be disposed of in accordance with the decision in the other proceeding, absent unusual circumstances.
</P>
<P>(c) Requests to amend records shall be submitted, in writing, to the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator in accordance with § 21.40(b). Such requests shall include information sufficient to enable the Food and Drug Administration to locate the record, a brief description of the items of information requested to be amended, and the reasons why the record should be amended together with any appropriate documentation or arguments in support of the requested amendment. An edited copy of the record showing the described amendment may be included. Verification of identity should be provided in accordance with § 21.44.
</P>
<P>(d) Written acknowledgement of the receipt of a request to amend a record shall be provided within 10 working days to the individual who requested the amendment.

</P>
<P>(2) Inform the individual of its refusal to amend any portion of the record in the manner requested, the reason for the refusal, and the opportunity for administrative appeal to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.

</P>
<P>(c) The officials charged with reviewing a record to determine how to respond to a request to amend it, shall assess its accuracy, relevance to a Food and Drug Administration purpose, timeliness, or completeness. The determination shall be made in the light of the purpose for which the records or system is used, the agency's need for the record, and the possible adverse consequences to the individual from the record if not amended. Whenever the Food and Drug Administration receives a request for deletion of a record, or portions of a record, it shall consider anew whether the contested information in the record is relevant and necessary to a Food and Drug Administration purpose.
</P>

<P>(3) Such records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G) and (H) and § 21.20(b)(1) requiring inclusion in the notice for the system of information about agency procedures for notification, access, and contest.
</P>
<P>(4) Such records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requiring that individuals asked to supply information be provided a form outlining the authority for the request, the purposes for which the information will be used, the routine uses in the notice for the Privacy Act Record System, and the consequences to the individual of not providing the information, but only with respect to records compiled by the Food and Drug Administration in a criminal law enforcement investigation where the conduct of the investigation would be prejudiced by such procedures.
</P>
<P>(b) Records in the following Food and Drug Administration Privacy Act Record Systems that concern individuals who are subject to Food and Drug Administration enforcement action and consist of investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, including criminal law enforcement purposes, are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2) from the provisions enumerated in paragraph (a) of this section:

<P>(a) Where a Privacy Act Record System is exempt and the requested records are unavailable under § 21.61, an individual may nevertheless make a request under § 21.40 for notification concerning whether any records about him exist and request access to such records where they are retrieved by his name or other personal identifier.
</P>
<P>(b) An individual making a request under paragraph (a) of this section;

<P>(2) Shall be given access upon request if the records requested are subject to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and not to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) (i.e., because they consist of investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes other than criminal law enforcement purposes) and maintenance of the records resulted in denial to the individual of any right, benefit, or privilege to which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law, or for which he would otherwise be eligible. An individual given access to a record under this paragraph (b)(2) is not entitled to seek amendment under subpart E of this part. The FDA may refuse to disclose a record that would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under a promise of confidentiality, which must be an express promise if the information was furnished on or after September 27, 1975. Any individual refused access to a record that would reveal a confidential source shall be advised in a general way that the record contains information that would reveal a confidential source.

<P>(a) All applications or petitions requesting agency action require the submission of an EA or a claim of categorical exclusion. A claim of categorical exclusion shall include a statement of compliance with the categorical exclusion criteria and shall state that to the applicant's knowledge, no extraordinary circumstances exist. Failure to submit an adequate EA for an application or petition requesting action by the agency of a type specified in § 25.20, unless the agency can determine that the action qualifies for exclusion under §§ 25.30, 25.31, 25.32, 25.33, 25.34, or 25.35 is sufficient grounds for FDA to refuse to file or approve the application or petition. An EA adequate for filing is one that addresses the relevant environmental issues. An EA adequate for approval is one that contains sufficient information to enable the agency to determine whether the proposed action may significantly affect the quality of the human environment.
</P>
<P>(b) The responsible agency officials will evaluate the information contained in the EA to determine whether it is accurate and objective, whether the proposed action may significantly affect the quality of the human environment, and whether an EIS will be prepared. If significant effects requiring the preparation of an EIS are identified, FDA will prepare an EIS for the action in accordance with the procedures in subparts D and E of this part. If significant effects requiring the preparation of an EIS are not identified, resulting in a decision not to prepare an EIS, the responsible agency official will prepare a FONSI in accordance with § 25.41.

<P>(a) As defined by CEQ in 40 CFR 1508.9, an EA is a concise public document that serves to provide sufficient evidence and analysis for an agency to determine whether to prepare an EIS or a FONSI. The EA shall include brief discussions of the need for the proposal, of alternatives as required by section 102(2)(E) of NEPA, of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, and a listing of agencies and persons consulted. An EA shall be prepared for each action not categorically excluded in § 25.30, § 25.31, § 25.32, § 25.33, or § 25.34, or § 25.35. The EA shall focus on relevant environmental issues relating to the use and disposal from use of FDA-regulated articles and shall be a concise, objective, and well-balanced document that allows the public to understand the agency's decision. If potentially adverse environmental impacts are identified for an action or a group of related actions, the EA shall discuss any reasonable alternative course of action that offers less environmental risk or that is environmentally preferable to the proposed action. The use of a scientifically justified tiered testing approach, in which testing may be stopped when the results suggest that no significant impact will occur, is an acceptable approach.

Applicants and petitioners are encouraged to submit proposed protocols for environmental studies for technical review by agency staff. Applicants and petitioners also are encouraged to consult applicable FDA EA guidance documents, which provide additional advice on how to comply with FDA regulations.

<P>(b) Many FDA actions involving investigations, review, and approval or market authorization of applications, and premarket notifications for human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, devices, and tobacco products are protected from disclosure under the Trade Secret Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, and section 301(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. These actions are also protected from disclosure under FDA's regulations including part 20, §§ 312.130(a), 314.430(b), 514.11(b), 514.12(a), 601.50(a), 601.51(a), 807.95(b), 812.38(a), and 814.9(b) of this chapter.

<HEAD>§ 133.111   Caciocavallo siciliano cheese.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Caciocavallo siciliano cheese is the food prepared from cow's milk or sheep's milk or goat's milk or mixtures of two or all of these and other ingredients specified in this section, by the procedure set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, or by another procedure which produces a finished cheese having the same physical and chemical properties as the cheese produced when the procedure set forth in paragraph (b) of this section is used. It has a stringy texture, and is made in oblong shapes. It contains not more than 40 percent of moisture, and its solids contain not less than 42 percent milkfat as determined by the methods prescribed in § 133.5 (a), (b), and (d). It is cured for not less than 90 days at a temperature of not less than 35 °F.
</P>
<P>(b) Milk, which may be pasteurized or clarified or both, and which may be warmed, is subjected to the action of harmless lactic-acid-producing bacteria, present in such milk or added thereto. Harmless artificial blue or green coloring in a quantity which neutralizes any natural yellow coloring in the curd may be added. Sufficient rennet, rennet paste, extract of rennet paste, or other safe and suitable milk-clotting enzyme that produces equivalent curd formation, singly or in any combination (with or without purified calcium chloride in a quantity not more than 0.02 percent, calculated as anhydrous calcium chloride, of the weight of the milk) is added to set the milk to a semisolid mass. The mass is cut, stirred, and heated so as to promote and regulate the separation of whey from curd. The whey is drained off, and the curd is removed to another vat containing hot whey, in which it is soaked for several hours. This whey is withdrawn, the curd is allowed to mat, and is cut into blocks. These are washed in hot whey until the desired elasticity is obtained. The curd is removed from the vat, drained, pressed into oblong forms, dried, and salted in brine, and cured. It may be paraffined. A harmless preparation of enzymes of animal or plant origin capable of aiding in the curing or development of flavor of caciocavallo siciliano cheese may be added during the procedure, in such quantity that the weight of the solids of such preparation is not more than 0.1 percent of the weight of the milk used.
</P>
<P>(c)(1) For the purposes of this section, the word “milk” means cow's milk or goat's milk or sheep's milk or mixtures of two or all of these. Such milk may be adjusted by separating part of the fat therefrom or (in the case of cow's milk) by adding one or more of the following: Cream, skim milk, concentrated skim milk, nonfat dry milk; (in the case of goat's milk) the corresponding products from goat's milk; (in the case of sheep's milk) the corresponding products from sheep's milk; water in a quantity sufficient to reconstitute any such concentrated or dried products used.
</P>
<P>(2) Such milk may be bleached by the use of benzoyl peroxide or a mixture of benzoyl peroxide with potassium alum, calcium sulfate, and magnesium carbonate; but the weight of the benzoyl peroxide is not more than 0.002 percent of the weight of the milk bleached, and the weight of the potassium alum, calcium sulfate, and magnesium carbonate, singly or combined, is not more than six times the weight of the benzoyl peroxide used. If milk is bleached in this manner, sufficient vitamin A is added to the curd to compensate for the vitamin A or its precursors destroyed in the bleaching process, and artificial coloring is not used.
</P>
<P>(d) Safe and suitable antimycotic agent(s), the cumulative levels of which shall not exceed current good manufacturing practice, may be added to the cheese during the kneading and stretching process and/or applied to the surface of the cheese.
</P>
<P>(e) When caciocavallo siciliano cheese is made solely from cow's milk, the name of such cheese is “Caciocavallo siciliano cheese”. When made from sheep's milk or goat's milk or mixtures of these, or one or both of these with cow's milk, the name is followed by the words “made from ______”, the blank being filled in with the name or names of the milks used, in order of predominance by weight.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Label declaration.</I> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter, except that enzymes of animal, plant, or microbial origin may be declared as “enzymes”.

<HEAD>§ 133.113   Cheddar cheese.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Description.</I> (1) Cheddar cheese is the food prepared by the procedure set forth in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, or by any other procedure which produces a finished cheese having the same physical and chemical properties. The minimum milkfat content is 50 percent by weight of the solids, and the maximum moisture content is 39 percent by weight, as determined by the methods described in § 133.5. If the dairy ingredients used are not pasteurized, the cheese is cured at a temperature of not less than 35 °F for at least 60 days.
</P>
<P>(2) If pasteurized dairy ingredients are used, the phenol equivalent value of 0.25 gram of cheddar cheese is not more than 3 micrograms as determined by the method described in § 133.5.
</P>
<P>(3) One or more of the dairy ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be warmed, treated with hydrogen peroxide/catalase, and is subjected to the action of a lactic acid-producing bacterial culture. One or more of the clotting enzymes specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is added to set the dairy ingredients to a semisolid mass. The mass is so cut, stirred, and heated with continued stirring, as to promote and regulate the separation of whey and curd. The whey is drained off, and the curd is matted into a cohesive mass. The mass is cut into slabs, which are so piled and handled as to promote the drainage of whey and the development of acidity. The slabs are then cut into pieces, which may be rinsed by sprinkling or pouring water over them, with free and continuous drainage; but the duration of such rinsing is so limited that only the whey on the surface of such pieces is removed. The curd is salted, stirred, further drained, and pressed into forms. One or more of the other optional ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may be added during the procedure.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Optional ingredients.</I> The following safe and suitable ingredients may be used:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Dairy ingredients.</I> Milk, nonfat milk, or cream, as defined in § 133.3, used alone or in combination.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Clotting enzymes.</I> Rennet and/or other clotting enzymes of animal, plant, or microbial origin.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Other optional ingredients.</I> (i) Coloring.
</P>
<P>(ii) Calcium chloride in an amount not more than 0.02 percent (calculated as anhydrous calcium chloride) of the weight of the dairy ingredients, used as a coagulation aid.

<HEAD>§ 133.118   Colby cheese.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Colby cheese is the food prepared from milk and other ingredients specified in this section, by the procedure set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, or by another procedure which produces a finished cheese having the same physical and chemical properties as the cheese produced when the procedure set forth in paragraph (b) of this section is used. It contains not more than 40 percent of moisture, and its solids contain not less than 50 percent of milkfat, as determined by the methods prescribed in § 133.5 (a), (b), and (d). If the milk used is not pasteurized, the cheese so made is cured at a temperature of not less than 35 °F for not less than 60 days.
</P>
<P>(b) Milk, which may be pasteurized or clarified or both, and which may be warmed, is subjected to the action of harmless lactic-acid-producing bacteria, present in such milk or added thereto. Harmless artificial coloring may be added. Sufficient rennet, or other safe and suitable milk-clotting enzyme that produces equivalent curd formation, or both, with or without purified calcium chloride in a quantity not more than 0.02 percent (calculated as anhydrous calcium chloride) of the weight of the milk, is added to set the milk to a semisolid mass. The mass is so cut, stirred, and heated with continued stirring, as to promote and regulate the separation of whey and curd. A part of the whey is drained off, and the curd is cooled by adding water, the stirring being continued so as to prevent the pieces of curd from matting. The curd is drained, salted, stirred, further drained, and pressed into forms. A harmless preparation of enzymes of animal or plant origin capable of aiding in the curing or development of flavor of colby cheese may be added during the procedure, in such quantity that the weight of the solids of such preparation is not more than 0.1 percent of the weight of the milk used.
</P>
<P>(c) For the purposes of this section:
</P>
<P>(1) The word “milk” means cow's milk, which may be adjusted by separating part of the fat therefrom or by adding thereto one or more of the following: Cream, skim milk, concentrated skim milk, nonfat dry milk, water, in a quantity sufficient to reconstitute any concentrated skim milk or nonfat dry milk used.
</P>
<P>(2) Milk shall be deemed to have been pasteurized if it has been held at a temperature of not less than 143 °F for a period of not less than 30 minutes, or for a time and at a temperature equivalent thereto in phosphatase destruction. Colby cheese shall be deemed not to have been made from pasteurized milk if 0.25 gram shows a phenol equivalent of more than 3 micrograms when tested by the method prescribed in § 133.5(c).
</P>
<P>(3) During the cheesemaking process the milk may be treated with hydrogen peroxide/catalase as provided in § 133.113(a)(3).
</P>
<P>(d)(1) Colby cheese in the form of slices or cuts may have added to it a clear aqueous solution prepared by condensing or precipitating wood smoke in water.
</P>
<P>(2) Colby cheese in the form of slices or cuts in consumer-sized packages may contain an optional mold-inhibiting ingredient consisting of sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, sodium sorbate, or any combination of two or more of these, in an amount not to exceed 0.3 percent by weight calculated as sorbic acid.

<P>(a) <I>Description.</I> (1) Gruyere cheese is the food prepared by the procedure set forth in paragraph (a)(3) of this section or by any other procedure which produces a finished cheese having the same physical and chemical properties. It contains small holes or eyes. It has a mild flavor, due in part to the growth of surface-curing agents. The minimum milkfat content is 45 percent by weight of the solids and the maximum moisture content is 39 percent by weight, as determined by the methods described in § 133.5. The dairy ingredients used may be pasteurized. The cheese is at least 90 days old.
</P>
<P>(2) If pasteurized dairy ingredients are used, the phenol equivalent value of 0.25 gram of gruyere cheese is not more than 3 micrograms as determined by the method described in § 133.5.

One or more of the clotting enzymes specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is added to set the dairy ingredients to a semisolid mass. The mass is cut into particles similar in size to wheat kernels. For about 30 minutes the particles are alternately stirred and allowed to settle. The temperature is raised to about 126 °F. Stirring is continued until the curd becomes firm. The curd is transferred to hoops or forms, and pressed until the desired shape and firmness are obtained. The cheese is surface-salted while held at a temperature of 48° to 54 °F for a few days. It is soaked for 1 day in a saturated salt solution. It is then held for 3 weeks in a salting cellar and wiped every 2 days with brine cloth to insure growth of biological curing agents on the rind. It is then removed to a heating room and held at progressively higher temperatures, finally reaching 65 °F with a relative humidity of 85 to 90 percent, for several weeks, during which time small holes, or so-called eyes, form. The cheese is then stored at a lower temperature for further curing. One or more of the other optional ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may be added during the procedure.

The mass is cut into cubes with sides approximately one-half inch long. After a few minutes the mass is stirred and heated, gradually raising the temperature to 96° to 98 °F. The curd is then allowed to settle, most of the whey is drained off, and the remaining curd and whey dipped into molds. During drainage the curd may be pressed. It is turned at regular intervals. After drainage the curd is cut into pieces of desired size and dry-salted at intervals for 24 to 48 hours. The cheese is then cured with frequent applications of a weak brine solution to the surface, until the proper growth of surface-curing organisms is obtained. It is then wrapped and held in storage for development of as much additional flavor as is desired. One or more of the other optional ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may be added during the procedure.
</P>
<P>(ii) One or more of the dairy ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is pasteurized, brought to a temperature of 89° to 90 °F. after pasteurization, and is subjected to the action of a lactic acid-producing bacterial culture.

<P>(ii) If the food contains both a natural characterizing flavor and an artificial flavor simulating it, and if the natural flavor predominates, the name on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be accompanied by the common name of the characterizing flavor, in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the words “ice cream”, followed by the word “flavored”, in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of the characterizing flavor, e.g., “Vanilla flavored”, or “Peach flavored”, or “Vanilla flavored and Strawberry flavored”.
</P>
<P>(iii) If the food contains both a natural characterizing flavor and an artificial flavor simulating it, and if the artificial flavor predominates, or if artificial flavor is used alone the name on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be accompanied by the common name of the characterizing flavor in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the words “ice cream”, preceded by “artificial” or “artificially flavored”, in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of the characterizing flavor, e.g., “artificial Vanilla”, or “artifically flavored Strawberry” or “artificially flavored Vanilla and artificially flavored Strawberry”.
</P>
<P>(3)(i) If the food is subject to the requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section or if it contains any artificial flavor not simulating the characterizing flavor, the label shall also bear the words “artificial flavor added” or “artificial ______ flavor added”, the blank being filled with the common name of the flavor simulated by the artificial flavor in letters of the same size and prominence as the words that precede and follow it.
</P>
<P>(ii) Wherever the name of the characterizing flavor appears on the label so conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions of purchase, the words prescribed by this paragraph shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow such name, in a size reasonably related to the prominence of the name of the characterizing flavor and in any event the size of the type is not less than 6-point on packages containing less than 1 pint, not less than 8-point on packages containing at least 1 pint but less than one-half gallon, not less than 10-point on packages containing at least one-half gallon but less than 1 gallon, and not less than 12-point on packages containing 1 gallon or over: <I>Provided, however,</I> That where the characterizing flavor and a trademark or brand are presented together, other written, printed, or graphic matter that is a part of or is associated with the trademark or brand, may intervene if the required words are in such relationship with the trademark or brand as to be clearly related to the characterizing flavor: <I>And provided further,</I> That if the finished product contains more than one flavor of ice cream subject to the requirements of this paragraph, the statements required by this paragraph need appear only once in each statement of characterizing flavors present in such ice cream, e.g., “Vanilla flavored, Chocolate, and Strawberry flavored, artificial flavors added”.
</P>
<P>(4) If the food contains both a natural characterizing flavor and an artificial flavor simulating the characterizing flavor, any reference to the natural characterizing flavor shall, except as otherwise authorized by this paragraph, be accompanied by a reference to the artificial flavor, displayed with substantially equal prominence, e.g., “strawberry and artificial strawberry flavor”.
</P>
<P>(5) An artificial flavor simulating the characterizing flavor shall be deemed to predominate:
</P>
<P>(i) In the case of vanilla beans or vanilla extract used in combination with vanillin if the amount of vanillin used is greater than 1 ounce per unit of vanilla constituent, as that term is defined in § 169.3(c) of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(ii) In the case of fruit or fruit juice used in combination with artificial fruit flavor, if the quantity of the fruit or fruit juice used is such that, in relation to the weight of the finished ice cream, the weight of the fruit or fruit juice, as the case may be (including water necessary to reconstitute partially or wholly dried fruits or fruit juices to their original moisture content) is less than 2 percent in the case of citrus ice cream, 6 percent in the case of berry or cherry ice cream, and 10 percent in the case of ice cream prepared with other fruits.
</P>
<P>(iii) In the case of nut meats used in combination with artificial nut flavor, if the quantity of nut meats used is such that, in relation to the finished ice cream the weight of the nut meats is less than 2 percent.

For example, if a combination ice cream contains less than 5 percent of bananas and less than 1 percent of almonds it would be “artificially flavored banana-almond ice cream”. However, if it contains more than 5 percent of bananas and more than 1 percent of almonds it would be “banana-almond flavored ice cream”.
</P>
<P>(6) If two or more flavors of ice cream are distinctively combined in one package, e.g., “Neapolitan” ice cream, the applicable provisions of this paragraph shall govern each flavor of ice cream comprising the combination.
</P>
<P>(7) Until September 14, 1998, when safe and suitable sweeteners other than nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners are used in the food, their presence shall be declared by their common or usual name on the principal display panel of the label as part of the statement of identity in letters that shall be no less than one-half the size of the type used in the term “ice cream” but in any case no smaller than one-sixteenth of an inch. If the food purports to be or is represented for special dietary use, it shall bear labeling in accordance with the requirements of part 105 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Label declaration.</I> Each of the ingredients used shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter, except that the sources of milkfat or milk solids not fat may be declared in descending order of predominance either by the use of all the terms “milkfat and nonfat milk” when one or any combination of two or more of the ingredients listed in § 101.4(b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(8), and (b)(9) of this chapter are used or, alternatively, as permitted in § 101.4 of this chapter. Under section 403(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, artificial color need not be declared in ice cream, except as required by § 101.22(c) or (k) of this chapter. Voluntary declaration of all colors used in ice cream and frozen custard is recommended.

<HEAD>§ 137.105   Flour.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Flour, white flour, wheat flour, plain flour, is the food prepared by grinding and bolting cleaned wheat, other than durum wheat and red durum wheat. To compensate for any natural deficiency of enzymes, malted wheat, malted wheat flour, malted barley flour, or any combination of two or more of these, may be used; but the quantity of malted barley flour so used is not more than 0.75 percent. Harmless preparations of α-amylase obtained from <I>Aspergillus oryzae,</I> alone or in a safe and suitable carrier, may be used. When tested for granulation as prescribed in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, not less than 98 percent of the flour passes through a cloth having openings not larger than those of woven wire cloth designated “212 µm (No. 70)” complying with the specifications for such cloth set forth in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists” (AOAC), 13th Ed. (1980), Table 1, “Nominal Dimensions of Standard Test Sieves (U.S.A. Standard Series),” under the heading “Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes,” which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <I>http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.</I> The flour is freed from bran coat, or bran coat and germ, to such extent that the percent of ash therein, calculated to a moisture-free basis, is not more than the sum of 
<FR>1/20</FR> of the percent of protein therein, calculated to a moisture-free basis, plus 0.35. Its moisture content is not more than 15 percent. It may contain ascorbic acid in a quantity not to exceed 200 parts per million as a dough conditioner. Unless such addition conceals damage or inferiority or makes the flour appear to be better or of greater value than it is, one or any combination of two or more of the following optional bleaching ingredients may be added in a quantity not more than sufficient for bleaching or, in case such ingredient has an artificial aging effect, in a quantity not more than sufficient for bleaching and such artificial aging effect:
</P>
<P>(1) Oxides of nitrogen.
</P>
<P>(2) Chlorine.
</P>
<P>(3) Nitrosyl chloride.
</P>
<P>(4) Chlorine dioxide.
</P>
<P>(5) One part by weight of benzoyl peroxide mixed with not more than six parts by weight of one or any mixture of two or more of the following: potassium alum, calcium sulfate, magnesium carbonate, sodium aluminum sulfate, dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, starch, calcium carbonate.
</P>
<P>(6) Acetone peroxides complying with the provisions of § 172.802 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(7) Azodicarbonamide (complying with the requirements of § 172.806 of this chapter, including the quantitative limit of not more than 45 parts per million).
</P>
<P>(b)(1) <I>Label declaration.</I> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(2) When ascorbic acid is added, the label shall bear the statement “Ascorbic acid added as a dough conditioner”. When the optional ingredient α-amylase obtained from <I>Aspergillus oryzae</I>” is used, it may alternatively be declared in the list of ingredients as “Fungal <I>alpha</I>-amylase,” “Fungal α-amylase”, “Enzyme”, or “Enzyme added for improved baking”. When any optional bleaching ingredient is used, the label shall bear the word “Bleached”. Wherever the name of the food appears on the label so conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions of purchase, the word “Bleached” shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow such name, without intervening written, printed, or graphic matter; except that where such name is a part of a trademark or brand, other written, printed, or graphic matter, which is also a part of such trademark or brand, may so intervene if the word “Bleached” is in such juxtaposition with such trademark or brand as to be conspicuously related to such name.
</P>
<P>(c) For the purposes of this section:
</P>
<P>(1) Ash is determined by the method prescribed in the AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), section 14.006, “Direct Method—Official Final Action,” under the heading “Ash (5),” which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (a) of this section. Ash is calculated to a moisture-free basis by subtracting the percent of moisture in the flour from 100, dividing the remainder into the percent of ash, and multiplying the quotient by 100.
</P>
<P>(2) Protein is 5.7 times the nitrogen as determined by the method prescribed in section 2.057, “Improved Kjeldahl Methods for Nitrate-Free Samples (20)—Official Final Action,” AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (a) of this section. Protein is calculated to a moisture-free basis by subtracting the percent of moisture in the flour from 100, dividing the remainder into the percent of protein, and multiplying the quotient by 100.
</P>
<P>(3) Moisture is determined by the method prescribed in the AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), sections 14.002 and 14.003, “Vacuum Oven Method (2)—Official Final Action,” under the heading “Total Solids Moisture, Indirect Method,” which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (a) of this section.
</P>
<P>(4) Granulation is determined as follows: Use No. 70 sieve complying with the specifications for “Nominal Dimensions of Standard Test Sieves (U.S.A. Standard Series)” prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section. Attach bottom pan to sieve in Ro-Tap sifter (or an equivalent sifter). Place half of a rubber ball or other sieving aid in the sieve. Pour 100 grams of the sample in the sieve and turn on the sifter with knocker. Sift exactly 5 minutes. Weigh the residue on the No. 70 sieve and convert to percentage.

</P>
<P>(1) Weigh 17 grams of the official sample into flask A, add 15-20 glass beads (4-6 mm. diameter), and connect this flask with the apparatus (fig. 22). Open stopcock C and by means of the leveling bulb E bring the displacement solution to the 25 cc. graduation above the zero mark. (This 25 cc. is a partial allowance for the volume of acid to be used in the decomposition.) Allow the apparatus to stand 1-2 minutes to insure that the temperature and pressure within the apparatus are the same as those of the room. Close the stopcock, lower the leveling bulb somewhat to reduce the pressure within the apparatus, and slowly run into the decomposition flask from burette F 45 cc. of sulfuric acid (1 + 5). To prevent the liberated carbon dioxide from escaping through the acid burette into the air, keep the displacement solution in the leveling bulb at all times during the decomposition at a lower level than that in the gas-measuring tube. Rotate and then vigorously agitate the decomposition flask for three minutes to mix the contents intimately. Allow to stand for 10 minutes to bring to equilibrium. Equalize the pressure in the measuring tube by means of the leveling bulb and read the volume of gas from the zero point on the tube. Deduct 20 cc. from this reading (this 20 cc. together with previous allowance of 25 cc. compensates for the 45 cc. acid used in the decomposition). Observe the temperature of the air surrounding the apparatus and also the barometric pressure and multiply the number of mL of gas evolved by the factor given in section 52.007, “Correction factors for gasometric determination of carbon dioxide,” AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), which is incorporated by reference (the availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (c) of this section), for the temperature and pressure observed. Divide the corrected reading by 100 to obtain the apparent percent by weight of carbon dioxide in the official sample.
</P>
<P>(2) Correct the apparent percent of carbon dioxide to compensate for varying atmospheric conditions by immediately assaying a synthetic sample by the same method in the same apparatus.
</P>
<P>(3) Prepare the synthetic sample with 16.2 grams of flour, 0.30 gram of monocalcium phosphate, 0.30 gram of salt, and a sufficient quantity of sodium bicarbonate U.S.P. (dried over sulfuric acid) to yield the amount of carbon dioxide recovered in assay of official sample. Determine this quantity by multiplying weight of carbon dioxide recovered in assay of official sample by 1.91.
</P>
<P>(4) Divide the weight of carbon dioxide recovered from synthetic sample by weight of carbon dioxide contained in sodium bicarbonate used.
</P>
<P>(5) Divide the quotient into the apparent percent of carbon dioxide in official sample to obtain percent of carbon dioxide evolved from the official sample.

Standard Series)” prescribed in § 137.105(a), which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <I>http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.</I> A sieve with frame of the same dimensions as the Nos. 12 and 25 and fitted with 72 XXX grits gauze is used as the third sieve. It is referred to hereafter as the No. 72 sieve. The 72 XXX grits gauze has openings equivalent in size with those of No. 70 woven-wire cloth, complying with specifications for such cloth contained in such “Standard Specifications for Sieves.” Attach bottom pan to No. 72 sieve. Fit the No. 25 sieve into the No. 72 sieve and the No. 12 sieve into the No. 25 sieve. Pour 100 grams of sample into the No. 12 sieve, attach cover and hold the assembly in a slightly inclined position and shake the assembly of sieves by striking the sides against one hand with an upward stroke, at the rate of about 150 times per minute. Turn the assembly of sieves about one-sixth of a revolution, each time in the same direction, after each 25 strokes. Continue shaking for 2 minutes. Weigh separately the material remaining on each sieve and in the pan, and calculate each weight as percent of sample. Sometimes when meals are tested, fine particles clog the sieve openings. If any sieve is clogged by fine material smaller than its openings, empty the contents onto a piece of paper. Remove the entrapped material on the bottom of the sieve by a hair brush and add to the sieve below. In like manner, clean the adhering material from inside the sieve and add to the material on the paper. Return mixture on the paper to the sieve, reassemble the sieves, and shake in the same manner as before for 1 minute. Repeat cleaning procedure if necessary until a 5-gram or less loss in weight occurs in any sieve during a 1-minute shaking. The percent of sample passing through No. 12 sieve shall be determined by subtracting from 100 percent, the percent of material remaining on the No. 12 sieve. The percent passing through a No. 25 sieve shall be determined by adding the percents remaining on the No. 72 sieve and the percent in pan. The percent in the pan shall be considered as the percent passing through a No. 72 XXX grits gauze.

</P>
<P>(1) Weigh 17 grams of the official sample into flask <I>A,</I> add 15-20 glass beads (4-6 mm. diameter), and connect this flask with the apparatus (fig. 25). Open stopcock <I>C</I> and by means of the leveling bulk <I>E</I> bring the displacement solution to the 25 cc. graduation above the zero mark. (This 25 cc. is a partial allowance for the volume of acid to be used in the decomposition.) Allow the apparatus to stand 1-2 minutes to insure that the temperature and pressure within the apparatus are the same as those of the room. Close the stopcock, lower the leveling bulb somewhat to reduce the pressure within the apparatus, and slowly run into the decomposition flask from burette <I>F</I> 45 cc. of sulfuric acid (1 + 5). To prevent the liberated carbon dioxide from escaping through the acid burette into the air keep the displacement solution in the leveling bulb at all times during the decomposition at a lower level than that in the gas-measuring tube. Rotate and then vigorously agitate the decomposition flask for 3 minutes to mix the contents intimately. Allow to stand for 10 minutes to bring to equilibrium. Equalize the pressure in the measuring tube by means of the leveling bulb and read the volume of gas from the zero point on the tube. Deduct 20 cc. from this reading (this 20 cc. together with previous allowance of 25 cc. compensates for the 45 cc. acid used in the decomposition). Observe the temperature of the air surrounding the apparatus and also the barometric pressure and multiply the number of mL of gas evolved by the factor given in the AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), section 52.007 under Reference Tables for the temperature and pressure observed, which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (b) of this section. Divide the corrected reading by 100 to obtain the apparent percent by weight of carbon dioxide in the official sample.
</P>
<P>(2) Correct the apparent percent of carbon dioxide to compensate for varying atmospheric conditions by immediately assaying a synthetic sample by the same method in the same apparatus.
</P>
<P>(3) Prepare the synthetic sample with 16.2 grams of corn meal, 0.30 gram of monocalcium phosphate, 0.30 gram of salt, and a sufficient quantity of sodium bicarbonate U.S.P. (dried over sulfuric acid) to yield the amount of carbon dioxide recovered in assay of official sample. Determine this quantity by multiplying weight of carbon dioxide recovered in assay of official sample by 1.91.
</P>
<P>(4) Divide the weight of carbon dioxide recovered from synthetic sample by weight of carbon dioxide contained in sodium bicarbonate used.

Agitate vigorously and wash down the sides of the flask with 150 milliliters of 0.1 <I>N</I> hydrochloric acid. In order to avoid excess foaming during the extraction, heat the mixture slowly to about 100 °C, agitate if necessary, and maintain at this temperature until air is expelled. Again wash down the sides of the flask with 150 milliliters of 0.1 <I>N</I> hydrochloric acid. Heat the mixture in an autoclave at 120 °C to 123 °C for 30 minutes, remove and cool to room temperature. Dilute the mixture with distilled water so that the total volume is 2,500 milliliters. Swirl the flask, and while the solids are in uniform suspension pour off about 250 milliliters of the mixture for later determination of iron (and calcium, if this is to be determined). With filter paper that has been shown not to adsorb thiamine, riboflavin, or niacin, filter enough of the remaining mixture for determination of thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin.

</P>
<P>(g) The terms <I>edible organic acid</I> and <I>edible organic salt</I> refer to any edible organic acid and any edible organic salt added for the purpose of flavor enhancement that either is not a food additive as defined in section 201(s) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or, if it is a food additive as so defined, is used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to section 409 of the act.
</P>
<P>(h) The term <I>water</I> means, in addition to water, any mixture of water and fruit juice in which the fruit juice(s) is less than 50 percent of such mixture, including any water contributed by the use of liquid nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners.
</P>
<P>(i) The term <I>fruit juice(s) and water</I> means any mixture of fruit juice as herein defined and water, including any water contributed by the use of liquid nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, in which the fruit juice(s) is 50 percent, or more, of such mixture except that water used in preparing equivalent single strength juice(s) from concentrate(s) shall not be considered to be a mixture of fruit juice and water.
</P>
<P>(j) The term <I>fruit juice(s)</I> means single strength expressed juice(s) of sound, mature fruit(s). It may be fresh, frozen, canned, or made from concentrate(s). However, if it is made from concentrate(s), the juice(s) shall be reconstituted with water to not less than the soluble solids that such fruit juice had before concentration. Fruit juice(s) may be used singly or in combination. If a fruit juice(s) is used which is regulated by a standard of identity of this chapter, it shall conform to the compositional requirements prescribed by such standard prior to the addition of any sweetener which may be used.
</P>
<P>(k) The term <I>clarified juice</I> means the liquid expressed wholly or in part from fruit peelings, fruit shells, fruit cores, or from the fruit flesh or parts thereof, which is clarified and may be further refined or concentrated.
</P>
<P>(l) The term <I>solid pack</I> means the product contains practically all fruit with only the very little free flowing liquid that is expressed from the fruit and to which no packing media have been added.
</P>
<P>(m) The procedure for determining the densities of the packing media means the following: The density of the packing medium, when measured 15 days or more after packing, or the density of the blended homogenized slurry of the comminuted entire contents of the container, when measured less than 15 days after canning, is determined according to “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), which is incorporated by reference, section 31.
<SU>6</SU>F011 (Solids) “By Means of the Refractometer—Official Final Action” (and sections 52.012 and 52.015) with result expressed as percent by weight of sucrose (degrees Brix) with correction for temperature to the equivalent at 20 °C, but without correction for invert sugar or other substances. Copies of the material incorporated by reference may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <I>http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.</I>
</P>
<P>(n) The procedure for determining drained weight is as follows: Tilt the opened container so as to distribute the contents evenly over the meshes of a circular sieve which has previously been weighed. The diameter of the sieve is 20.3 centimeters (8 inches) if the quantity of contents of the container is less than 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) and 30.5 centimeters (12 inches) if such quantity is 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) or more. The bottom of the sieve is woven-wire cloth which complies with the specifications for the No. 8 sieve set forth in the “Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes” of the “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (m) of this section. Carefully invert by hand all fruits having cups or cavities if they fall on the sieve with cups or cavities up. Cups or cavities in soft products may be drained by tilting sieve. Without further shifting the material on the sieve, incline the sieve at an angle of 17° to 20° to facilitate drainage. Two minutes after the drainage begins, weigh the sieve and drained fruit. The weight so found, less the weight of the sieve, shall be considered to be the weight of the drained fruit.
</P>
<P>(o) Compliance means the following: Unless otherwise provided in a standard, a lot of canned fruits shall be deemed in compliance for the following factors, to be determined by the sampling and acceptance procedure as provided in paragraph (p) of this section, namely:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Packing medium density.</I> A lot shall be deemed to be in compliance for packing medium density based on the average sucrose value for all samples analyzed according to the sampling plans, but no container may have a sucrose value lower than that of the next lower category or 2 percent by weight sucrose (degrees Brix) lower if no lower category exists.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Quality.</I> The quality of a lot shall be considered acceptable when the number of defectives does not exceed the acceptance number in the sampling plans.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Fill of container.</I> A lot shall be deemed to be in compliance for fill of container (packing medium and fruit ingredient) when the number of defectives does not exceed the acceptance number (c) in the sampling plans.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Drained weight.</I> A lot shall be deemed to be in compliance for drained weight based on the average value of all samples analyzed according to the sampling plans. The sample unit shall be the entire contents of the container.
</P>
<P>(p) The sampling and acceptance procedure means the following:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Definitions</I>—(i) <I>Lot.</I> A collection of primary containers or units of the same size, type, and style manufactured or packed under similar conditions and handled as a single unit of trade.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Lot size.</I> The number of primary containers or units in the lot.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Sample size.</I> The total number of sample units drawn for examination from a lot.
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>Sample unit.</I> A container, a portion of the contents of a container, or a composite mixture of product from small containers that is sufficient for the examination or testing as a single unit.
</P>
<P>(v) <I>Defective.</I> Any sample unit shall be regarded as defective when the sample unit does not meet the criteria set forth in the standards.
</P>
<P>(vi) <I>Acceptance number</I> (<I>c</I>). The maximum number of defective sample units permitted in the sample in order to consider the lot as meeting the specified requirements.
</P>
<P>(vii) <I>Acceptable quality level</I> (<I>AQL</I>). The maximum percent of defective sample units permitted in a lot that will be accepted approximately 95 percent of the time.

<HEAD>§ 145.110   Canned applesauce.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Identity</I>—(1) <I>Definition.</I> Canned applesauce is the food prepared from comminuted or chopped apples (<I>Malus domestica</I> Borkhausen), which may or may not be peeled and cored, and which may have added thereto one or more of the optional ingredients specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The apple ingredient is heated and, in accordance with good manufacturing practices, bruised apple particles, peel, seed, core material, carpel tissue, and other coarse, hard, or extraneous materials are removed. The food is sealed in containers. It is so processed by heat, either before or after sealing, as to prevent spoilage. The soluble solids content, measured by refractometer and expressed as percent sucrose (degrees Brix) with correction for temperature to the equivalent at 20 °C (68 °F), is not less than 9 percent (exclusive of the solids of any added optional nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners) as determined by the method prescribed in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), section 22.024, “Soluble Solids by Refractometer in Fresh and Canned Fruits, Jams, Marmalades, and Preserves—Official First Action,” which is incorporated by reference, but without correction for invert sugar or other substances. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <I>http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.</I>
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Optional ingredients.</I> The following safe and suitable optional ingredients may be used:
</P>
<P>(i) Water.
</P>
<P>(ii) Apple juice.
</P>
<P>(iii) Salt.
</P>
<P>(iv) Any organic acid added for the purpose of acidification. (Organic acids generally recognized as having a preservative effect are not permitted in applesauce except as provided for in paragraph (a)(2)(viii) of this section.)
</P>
<P>(v) Nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners.
</P>
<P>(vi) Spices.
</P>
<P>(vii) Natural and artificial flavoring.
</P>
<P>(viii) Either of the following:
</P>
<P>(<I>a</I>) Erythorbic acid or ascorbic acid as an antioxidant preservative in an amount not to exceed 150 parts per million; or
</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in a quantity such that the total vitamin C in each 113 g (4 ounces) by weight of the finished food amounts to 60 mg. This requirement will be deemed to have been met if a reasonable overage of the vitamin, within limits of good manufacturing practice, is present to insure that the required level is maintained throughout the expected shelf life of the food under customary conditions of distribution.
</P>
<P>(ix) Color additives in such quantity as to distinctly characterize the food unless such addition conceals damage or inferiority or makes the finished food appear better or of greater value than it is.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Nomenclature.</I> The name of the food is “applesauce”. The name of the food shall include a declaration indicating the presence of any flavoring that characterizes the product as specified in § 101.22 of this chapter and a declaration of any spice that characterizes the product. If a nutritive sweetener as provided for in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section is added and the soluble solids content of the finished food is not less than 16.5 percent as determined by the method referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the name may include the word “sweetened”. If no such sweetener is added, the name may include the word “unsweetened”.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Label declaration.</I> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter. However, when ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is added as provided for in paragraph (a)(2)(viii)(<I>b</I>) of this section, after the application of heat to the apples, preservative labeling requirements do not apply.
</P>
<P>(b) [Reserved]
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Fill of container.</I> (1) The standard of fill of container for canned applesauce is a fill of not less than 90 percent of the total capacity of the container, as determined by the general method for fill of containers prescribed in § 130.12(b) of this chapter; except that in the case of glass containers having a total capacity of 192 ml (6
<FR>1/2</FR> fluid ounces) or less, the fill is not less than 85 percent.
</P>
<P>(2) Sampling and acceptance procedure: A lot will be deemed to fall below the standard of fill when the number of “defectives” exceeds the acceptance number “c” in the sampling plans prescribed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
</P>
<P>(i) Definitions of terms to be used in the sampling plans in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are as follows:
</P>
<P>(<I>a</I>) <I>Lot.</I> A collection of primary containers or units of the same size, type, and style manufactured or packed under similar conditions and handled as a single unit of trade.
</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) <I>Lot size.</I> The number of primary containers or units in the lot.
</P>
<P>(<I>c</I>) <I>Sample size “n.”</I> The total number of sample units drawn for examination from a lot as indicated in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
</P>
<P>(<I>d</I>) <I>Sample unit.</I> A container, the entire contents of a container, a portion of the contents of a container, or a composite mixture of product from small containers that is sufficient for examination or testing as a single unit.
</P>
<P>(<I>e</I>) <I>Defective.</I> A container that falls below the requirement for minimum fill prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is considered a “defective.”
</P>
<P>(<I>f</I>) <I>Acceptable number “c.”</I> The maximum number of defective sample units permitted in the sample in order to consider the lot as meeting the specified requirements.
</P>
<P>(<I>g</I>) <I>Acceptable quality level</I> (<I>AQL</I>). The maximum percent of defective sample units permitted in a lot that will be accepted approximately 95 percent of the time.

When two or more of the optional ingredients specified in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) through (iv), inclusive, of this section are used, such words may be combined as for example, “Seasoned with Cider Vinegar, Cloves, Cinnamon Oil and Apricot Kernels”.
</P>
<P>(ii) The style of the apricot ingredient as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the name of the packing medium as used in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, preceded by “In” or “Packed in” or the words “solid pack”, where applicable, shall be included as part of the name or in close proximity to the name of the food, except that pieces or irregular pieces shall be designated “Pieces”, “Irregular pieces”, or “Mixed pieces of irregular sizes and shapes”. The style of the apricot ingredient shall be preceded or followed by “Unpeeled” or “Peeled”, as the case may be. “Halves” may be alternatively designated “Halved”, “Quarters” as “Quartered” and “Slices” as “Sliced”. When the packing medium is prepared with a sweetener(s) which imparts a taste, flavor or other characteristic to the finished food in addition to sweetness, the name of the packing medium shall be accompanied by the name of such sweetener(s), as for example in the case of a mixture of brown sugar and honey, an appropriate statement would be “______ sirup of brown sugar and honey” the blank to be filled in with the word “light”, “heavy”, or “extra heavy” as the case may be. When the liquid portion of the packing media provided for in paragraphs (a)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section consists of fruit juice(s), such juice(s) shall be designated in the name of the packing medium as:
</P>
<P>(<I>a</I>) In the case of a single fruit juice, the name of the juice shall be used in lieu of the word “fruit”.
</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) In the case of a combination of two or more fruit juices, the names of the juices in the order of predominance by weight shall either be used in lieu of the word “fruit” in the name of the packing medium, or be declared on the label as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, and
</P>
<P>(<I>c</I>) In the case of a single fruit juice or a combination of two or more fruit juices any of which are made from concentrate(s), the words “from concentrate(s)” shall follow the word “juice(s)” in the name of the packing medium and in the name(s) of such juice(s) when declared as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.
</P>
<P>(iii) Whenever the names of the fruit juices used do not appear in the name of the packing medium as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(<I>b</I>) of this section, such names and the words “from concentrate,” as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(<I>c</I>) of this section, shall appear in an ingredient statement pursuant to the requirements of § 101.3(d) of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>Label declaration.</I> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Quality.</I> (1) The standard of quality for canned apricots is as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) All units tested in accordance with the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are pierced by a weight of not more than 300 grams.
</P>
<P>(ii) In the cases of whole apricots, halves, and quarters, the weight of the largest unit in the container is not more than twice the weight of the smallest unit therein.
</P>
<P>(iii) Not more than 20 percent of the units in the container are blemished with scab, hail injury, discoloration, or other abnormalities.
</P>
<P>(iv) In the cases of whole apricots, halves, and quarters, all units are untrimmed, or are so trimmed as to preserve normal shape.
</P>
<P>(v) Except in the case of mixed pieces of irregular sizes and shapes, not more than 5 percent of the units in a container of 20 or more units, and not more than 1 unit in a container of less than 20 units, are crushed or broken. (A unit which has lost its normal shape because of ripeness and which bears no mark of crushing shall not be considered to be crushed or broken.)
</P>
<P>(2) Canned apricots shall be tested by the following method to determine whether or not they meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section: So trim a test piece from the unit as to fit, with peel surface up, into a supporting receptacle. If the unit is of different firmness in different parts of its peel surface, trim the piece from the firmest part. If the piece is unpeeled, remove the peel. The top of the receptacle is circular in shape, of 1
<FR>1/8</FR> inches inside diameter, with vertical sides; or rectangular in shape, 
<FR>3/4</FR> inch by 1 inch inside measurements, with ends vertical and sides sloping downward and joining at the center at a vertical depth of 
<FR>3/4</FR> inch. Use the circular receptacle for testing units of such size that a test piece can be trimmed therefrom to fit it. Use the rectangular receptacle for testing other units. Test no unit from which a test piece with rectangular peel surface at least 
<FR>1/2</FR> inch by 1 inch cannot be trimmed. Test the piece by means of a round metal rod 
<FR>3/16</FR> inch in diameter. To the upper end of the rod is affixed a device to which weight can be added. The rod is held vertically by a support through which it can freely move upward or downward. The lower end of the rod is a plane surface to which the vertical axis of the rod is perpendicular. Adjust the combined weight of the rod and device to 100 grams. Set the receptacle so that the surface of the test piece is held horizontally. Lower the end of the rod to the approximate center of such surface, and add weight to the device at a uniform, continuous rate of 12 grams per second until the rod pierces the test piece. Weigh the rod and weighted device. Test all units in containers of 50 units or less, except those units too small for testing or too soft for trimming. Test at least 50 units, taken at random, in containers of more than 50 units; but if less than 50 units are of sufficient size and firmness for testing, test those which are of sufficient size and firmness.

</P>
<P>(i) In the case of pitted cherries, not more than 1 pit is present in each 20 ounces of canned cherries, as determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. 
</P>
<P>(ii) In the case of unpitted cherries, the weight of each cherry in the container is not less than 
<FR>1/10</FR> ounce.
</P>
<P>(iii) In the case of unpitted cherries, the weight of the largest cherry in the container is not more than twice the weight of the smallest cherry therein.
</P>
<P>(iv) In the case of unpitted cherries, the total weight of pits is not more than 12 percent of the weight of drained cherries, as determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
</P>
<P>(v) Not more than 15 percent by count of the cherries in the container are blemished with scab, hail injury, discoloration, scar tissue or other abnormality. A cherry showing skin discoloration (other than scald) having an aggregate area exceeding that of a circle 
<FR>9/32</FR> inch in diameter is considered to be blemished. A cherry showing discoloration of any area but extending into the fruit tissue is also considered to be blemished.
</P>
<P>(2)(i) Pitted canned cherries shall be tested by the following method to determine whether or not they comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section: Take at random such number of containers as to have a total quantity of contents of at least 24 pounds. Open the containers and weigh the contents. Count the pits and pieces of pit shell in such total quantity. Count a piece of pit shell equal to or smaller than one-half pit shell as one-half pit, and a piece of pit shell larger than one-half pit shell as one pit; but when two or more pieces of pit shell are within or attached to a single cherry, count such pieces as one-half pit if their combined size is equivalent to that of one-half pit shell or less, and as one pit if their combined size is equivalent to that of more than one-half pit shell. From the total number of pits so counted and the combined weight of the contents of all the containers, calculate the number of pits present in each 20 ounces of canned cherries.
</P>
<P>(ii) Unpitted canned cherries shall be tested by the following method to determine whether or not they comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section: Tilt the opened container so as to distribute the contents over the meshes of a circular sieve which has previously been weighed.

<P>(2) Drained weight is determined by the following method: Tilt the opened container so as to distribute the contents evenly over the meshes of a circular sieve which has previously been weighed. The diameter of the sieve is 20.3 centimeters (8 inches) if the quantity of contents of the container is less than 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) and 30.5 centimeters (12 inches) if such quantity is 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) or more. The bottom of the sieve is woven-wire cloth that complies with the specifications for the No. 8 sieve set forth in the “Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes” of the AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), Table 1, which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section. Without shifting the material on the sieve, incline the sieve at an angle of 17° to 20° to facilitate drainage. Two minutes after the drainage begins, weigh the sieve and drained grapefruit. The weight so found, less the weight of the sieve, shall be considered to be the weight of the drained grapefruit.
</P>
<P>(3)(i) A container that falls below the requirement for minimum fill prescribed in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall be considered a “defective”. The food will be deemed to fall below the standard of fill when the number of defectives exceeds the acceptance number (c) in the sampling plans prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) Canned grapefruit will be deemed to fall below the standard of fill when the average drained weight of all containers analyzed when sampled according to the sampling plans prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is less than that prescribed in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
</P>
<P>(4) If canned grapefruit falls below the standard of fill of container prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.

</P>
<P>(b) <I>Quality.</I> (1) The standard of quality for canned peaches is as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Maturity.</I> All units tested in accordance with the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are pierced by weight of not more than 300 grams (10.6 ounces).
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Minimum size.</I> In the case of halves and quarters styles, the weight of each unit is not less than 17 grams (0.6 ounce) and 8.5 grams (0.3 ounce), respectively.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Uniformity of size</I>—(<I>a</I>) <I>Whole, halves, and quarters.</I> In the case of whole, halves, and quarters styles, the diameter (width) of the largest unit is not more than 1.5 centimeters (0.6 inch) greater than the diameter (width) of the smallest unit. In containers with more than 20 units, 2 units may be disregarded in making the determination. Where a unit has broken in the container, the combined broken pieces are to be reassembled to approximate a single unit of the appropriate style.
</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) <I>Chunky.</I> In the case of chunky style, not more than 25 percent of the drained weight of the contents of the container consists of units that will pass through an opening 13 millimeters (0.5 inch) wide or that are more than 44 millimeters (1.75 inches) along the longest cut edge.
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>Peel.</I> Not more than 15 square centimeters aggregate area of peel per 1,000 grams (1.05 square inches per 16 ounces) of net weight. Include any peel adhering to the peach or loose in the container.
</P>
<P>(v) <I>Blemished units.</I> Not more than 20 percent by count of the units in the container are blemished, e.g., with scab, hail injury, discoloration, or other abnormalities. Blemished units are units which contain surface discolorations that definitely contrast with the overall color and may penetrate into the flesh.
</P>
<P>(vi) <I>Trimmed units.</I> In the case of whole, halves, quarters, and slices styles, all units are untrimmed or are so trimmed as to preserve normal shape of the units.
</P>
<P>(vii) <I>Crushed or broken units.</I> In the case of whole, halves, halves and pieces, quarters, slices, dice and chunky styles, not more than 5 percent by count of the units in containers of 20 or more units and not more than 1 unit in containers of fewer than 20 units are crushed or broken. A unit that has lost its normal shape because of ripeness and bears no mark of crushing shall not be considered crushed or broken.
</P>
<P>(viii) <I>Pits and pieces of pit.</I> In the case of all styles, except whole peaches and when whole peach pits or peach kernels are used as seasoning ingredients, there is not more than one loose pit or one loose large hard piece of pit (10 millimeters (
<FR>3/8</FR> inch) or larger) or one unit of peach (e.g., peach half or peach slice) to which one or more large hard pieces of pit are attached per 5.67 kilograms (200 ounces) net weight. In addition, there is not more than three of any one or any combination of two or more, per 2.83 kilograms (100 ounces) net weight of the following: (<I>a</I>) A unit to which one or more small hard pieces of pit less than 10 millimeters (
<FR>3/8</FR> inch) but not less than 1.6 millimeters (
<FR>1/16</FR> inch) are attached, (<I>b</I>) a unit to which three or more small pieces of pit less than 1.6 millimeters (
<FR>1/16</FR> inch) are attached, or (<I>c</I>) a loose small hard piece of pit less than 10 millimeters (
<FR>3/8</FR> inch).
</P>
<P>(2) Canned peaches shall be tested by the following method to determine whether or not they meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section: So trim a test piece from the unit as to fit, with peel surface up, into a supporting receptacle. If the unit is of different firmness in different parts of its peel surface, trim the piece from the firmest part. If the piece is unpeeled, remove the peel. The top of the receptacle is circular in shape, of 29 millimeters (1.125 inches) inside diameter, with vertical sides; or rectangular in shape, 19 millimeters (0.75 inch) by 25 millimeters (1 inch) inside measurements, with ends vertical and sides sloping downward and joining at the center at a vertical depth of 19 millimeters (0.75 inch). Use the circular receptacle for testing units of such size that a test piece can be trimmed therefrom to fit it. Use the rectangular receptacle for testing other units. Test no unit from which a test piece with a rectangular peel surface at least 13 millimeters (0.51 inch) by 25 millimeters (1 inch) cannot be trimmed. Test the piece by means of a round metal rod 4 millimeters (0.16 inch) in diameter. To the upper end of the rod is affixed a device to which weight can be added. The rod is held vertically by a support through which it can freely move upward or downward. The lower end of the rod is a plane surface to which the vertical axis of the rod is perpendicular. Adjust the combined weight of the rod and device to 100 grams (3.53 ounces). Set the receptacle so that the surface of test piece is held horizontally. Lower the end of the rod to the approximate center of such surface, and add weight to the device at a uniform, continuous rate of 12 grams (0.45 ounce) per second until the rod pierces the test piece. Weigh the rod and weighted device. Test all units in containers of 50 units or less, except those units too small for testing or too soft for trimming. Test at least 50 units, taken at random, in containers of more than 50 units; but if less than 50 units are of sufficient size and firmness for testing, test those which are of sufficient size and firmness.
</P>
<P>(3) Determine compliance as specified in § 145.3(o) except that a lot shall be deemed to be in compliance for peel, pits, and pieces of pit based on the average of all samples analyzed according to the sampling plans set out in § 145.3(p).
</P>
<P>(4) If the quality of canned peaches falls below the standard prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality defined in § 130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified; however, if the quality of the canned peaches falls below standard with respect to only one of the factors of quality specified in paragraph (b)(1) (i) through (viii) of this section, there may be substituted for the second line of such general statement of substandard quality (“Good Food—Not High Grade”) a new line, as specified after the corresponding designation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section which the canned peaches fail to meet, as follows: (i) “Not tender”; (ii) “Small halves” or “Small quarters” as the case may be; (iii) (<I>a</I>) “Mixed sizes”; (<I>b</I>) “Undersized and/or oversized pieces”, (iv) “Excess peel”; (v) “Blemished”; (vi) “Unevenly trimmed”; (vii) “Partly crushed or broken”; (viii) “Contains pits or pit fragments”. Such alternative statement shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow, without intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, the name “peaches” and any words and statements required or authorized to appear with such name by paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Fill of container.</I> (1) The standard of fill of container for canned peaches is the maximum quantity of the optional peach ingredient that can be sealed in the container and processed by heat to prevent spoilage, without crushing or breaking such ingredient.
</P>
<P>(2) If canned peaches fall below the standard of fill of container prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.

<P>(iv) <I>Label declaration.</I> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Quality.</I> (1) The standard of quality for canned pears is as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Maturity.</I> All units tested in accordance with the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are pierced by a weight of not more than 300 grams (10.6 ounces).
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Minimum size.</I> In the case of halves and quarters styles, the weight of each unit is not less than 17 grams (0.6 ounce) and 8.5 grams (0.3 ounce), respectively.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Uniformity of size</I>—(<I>a</I>) <I>Whole, halves, and quarters.</I> In the case of whole, halves, and quarters styles, among those units comprising 95 percent by count of those present in the container that are most uniform in size, the weight of the largest unit is not more than twice the weight of the smallest unit. In containers with fewer than 20 units, 1 unit may be disregarded in making the determination. Where a unit has broken in the container, reassemble the broken pieces to approximate a single unit of the appropriate style.
</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) <I>Chunky.</I> In the case of chunky style, not more than 25 percent of the drained weight of the contents of the container consists of units that will pass through an opening 13 millimeters (0.51 inch) wide or that are more than 44 millimeters (1.75 inches) along the longest cut edge.
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>Peel (except unpeeled style).</I> Not more than 10 square centimeters (1.6 square inches) of peel adhering to pears or loose in the container per kilogram (35.3 ounces) of net weight.
</P>
<P>(v) <I>Blemished units.</I> Not more than 20 percent by count of the units in the container are blemished with scab, hail injury, discoloration, or other abnormality aggregating the area of a circle more than 6.5 millimeters (0.25 inch) in diameter; corky or hard spots on outer surfaces aggregating the area of a circle more than 13 millimeters (0.51 inch) in diameter; or dark brown areas aggregating the area of a circle less than 6.5 millimeters (0.25 inch) in diameter which penetrate into the flesh or affect the appearance of the unit.
</P>
<P>(vi) <I>Trimmed units.</I> In the case of whole, halves, and quarters styles, all units are untrimmed or are so trimmed as to preserve normal shape of the unit.
</P>
<P>(vii) <I>Crushed or broken units.</I> In the case of whole, halves, quarter, slices, dice, and chunky styles, not more than 10 percent by count of the units in containers of 10 or more units and not more than 1 unit in containers of less than 10 units are crushed or broken. A unit that lost its normal shape because of ripeness and bears no mark of crushing shall not be considered to be crushed or broken.
</P>
<P>(viii) <I>Loose core material in all styles except uncored whole style.</I> Not more than two units of loose core material per kilogram (35.3 ounces) of net weight. A unit of such material is defined as a portion of loose core, with or without seeds, aggregating approximately one-half of a pear core.
</P>
<P>(ix) <I>Partially cored units in all styles except uncored whole style.</I> Not more than 40 percent by count partially cored units in halves, quarters, slices, and pieces or irregular pieces styles and not more than 5 percent by weight in dice style. A partially cored unit is a unit of pear that contains an attached portion of the seed cell cavity.

<P>(x) <I>Seeds in all styles except whole uncored style.</I> Not more than 8 seeds or the equivalent in pieces of seeds per kilogram (35.3 ounces) of net weight. Seeds included as cored material in paragraph (b)(1) (viii) and (ix) of this section shall not be counted a second time.
</P>
<P>(2) Canned pears shall be tested by the following method to determine whether they meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section: So trim a test piece from the unit as to fit, with peel surface up, into a supporting receptacle. If the unit is of different firmness in different parts of its peel surface, trim the piece from the firmest part. If the piece is unpeeled, remove the peel. The top of the receptacle is circular in shape, of 28.6 millimeters (1.12 inches) inside diameter, with vertical sides; or rectangular in shape, 19 millimeters (0.75 inch) by 25.4 millimeters (1 inch) inside measurements, with ends vertical and sides sloping downward and joining at the center at a vertical depth of 19 millimeters (0.75 inch). Use the circular receptacle for testing units of such size that a test piece can be trimmed therefrom to fit it. Use the rectangular receptacle for testing other units. Test no unit from which a test piece with rectangular peel surface at least 13 millimeters (0.51 inch) by 25.4 millimeters (1 inch) cannot be trimmed. Test the piece by means of a round metal rod 4 millimeters (0.16 inch) in diameter. To the upper end of the rod is affixed a device to which weight can be added. The rod is held vertically by the support through which it can freely move upward or downward. The lower end of the rod is a plane surface to which the vertical axis of the rod is perpendicular. Adjust the combined weight of the rod and device to 100 grams (3.5 ounces). Set the receptacle so that the surface of the test piece is held horizontally. Lower the end of the rod to the approximate center of such surface, and add weight to the device at a uniform, continuous rate of 12 grams (0.42 ounce) per second until the rod pierces the test piece. Weigh the rod and weighted device. Test all units in containers of 50 units or less except those units too small for testing or too soft for trimming. Test at least 50 units, taken at random in containers of more than 50 units; but if less than 50 units are of sufficient size and firmness for testing, test those which are of sufficient size and firmness.
</P>
<P>(3) Determine compliance as specified in § 145.3(o) except that a lot shall be deemed to be in compliance for peel in all styles except unpeeled styles and seeds in all styles except whole uncored style based on the average of all samples analyzed according to the sampling plans set out in § 145.3(p).
</P>
<P>(4) If the quality of canned pears falls below the standard prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality specified in § 130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified; however, if the quality of the canned pears falls below standard with respect to only one of the factors of quality specified in paragraph (b)(1) (i) through (x) of this section, there may be substituted for the second line of such general statement of substandard quality (“Good Food—Not High Grade”) a new line, as specified after the corresponding designation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section which the canned pears fail to meet, as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) “Not tender”;
</P>
<P>(ii) “Small halves” or “small quarters”, as the case may be;
</P>
<P>(iii)(<I>a</I>) “Mixed sizes”;
</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) “Undersized and/or oversized pieces”;
</P>
<P>(iv) “Excessive peel”;
</P>
<P>(v) “Blemished”;
</P>
<P>(vi) “Unevenly trimmed”;
</P>
<P>(vii) “Partly crushed or broken”;
</P>
<P>(viii) “Excessive core”;
</P>
<P>(ix) “Excessive core”;
</P>
<P>(x) “Excessive seeds”.
</P>
<FP>Such alternative statement shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow, without intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, the name “pears” and any words and statements required or authorized to appear with such name by paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
</FP>
<P>(c) <I>Fill of container.</I> (1) The standard of fill of container for canned pears is the maximum quantity of the optional pear ingredient that can be sealed in the container and processed by heat to prevent spoilage, without crushing or breaking such ingredient.
</P>
<P>(2) If canned pears fall below the standard of fill of container prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.

<P>(i) Determine the drained weight of the canned pineapple by the procedure prescribed in § 145.3(n).
</P>
<P>(ii) Identify and separate any core material cleanly from each of the units in the container, and weigh the aggregate of the core material. Calculate the percent core material to determine compliance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
</P>
<P>(iii) In the case of slices, half slices, quarter slices, spears, tidbits, chunks, and pieces, check the weight of the units against the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) (<I>a</I>), (<I>b</I>), (<I>d</I>), (<I>e</I>), (<I>f</I>), and (<I>h</I>) of this section.
</P>
<P>(iv) In the case of broken slices, check the dimensions of each unit against the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(<I>c</I>) of this section.
</P>
<P>(v) In the case of cubes, and pieces, determine compliance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) (<I>g</I>) and (<I>h</I>) of this section by placing the units, a few at a time, on the mesh of a U.S. Standard No. 8 sieve (8-millimeter (0.31 inch)) mesh. After shaking gently, remove those units that remain on the sieve before testing the next portion. Continue portion-wise until all units are tested, then determine the aggregate weight of those units that have passed through the sieve.
</P>
<P>(vi) Except in the case of crushed pineapple, segregate and count each unit that is blemished as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. In the case of crushed pineapple, segregate each fragment of crushed pineapple bearing a blemish and determine the aggregate weight of such fragments to determine compliance with paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(<I>b</I>) of this section.
</P>

<HEAD>§ 146.114   Lemon juice.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Identity</I>—(1) <I>Description.</I> Lemon juice is the unfermented juice, obtained by mechanical process, from sound, mature lemons (<I>Citrus limon</I> (L.) Burm. f.), from which seeds (except embryonic seeds and small fragments of seed which cannot be separated by good manufacturing practice) and excess pulp are removed. The juice may be adjusted by the addition of the optional concentrated lemon juice ingredient specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section in such quantity so that the increase in acidity, calculated as anhydrous citric acid, does not exceed 15 percent of the acidity of the finished food. The lemon oil and lemon essence (derived from lemons) content may be adjusted in accordance with good manufacturing practice. The juice may have been concentrated and later reconstituted. When prepared from concentrated lemon juice, the finished food contains not less than 6 percent, by weight, of soluble solids taken as the refractometric sucrose value (of the filtrate), corrected to 20 °C, but uncorrected for acidity, in accordance with the “International Scale of Refractive Indices of Sucrose Solutions” in section 52.012 of “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), which is incorporated by reference, and has a titratable acidity content of not less than 4.5 percent, by weight, calculated as anhydrous citrus acid. Copies of the incorporation by reference may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <I>http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.</I> The food may contain one or any combination of the safe and suitable optional ingredients specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Lemon juice, as defined in this paragraph, may be preserved by heat sterilization (canning), refrigeration, freezing, or by the addition of safe and suitable preservatives. When sealed in a container to be held at ambient temperatures, it is preserved by the addition of safe and suitable preservatives or so processed by heat, before or after sealing, as to prevent spoilage.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Optional ingredients.</I> The optional safe and suitable ingredients referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are:
</P>
<P>(i) Concentrated lemon juice (lemon juice from which part of the water has been removed).
</P>
<P>(ii) Water and/or lemon juice to reconstitute concentrated lemon juice in the manufacture of lemon juice from concentrate.
</P>
<P>(iii) Preservatives.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Labeling.</I> (i) The name of the food is:
</P>
<P>(<I>a</I>) “Lemon juice” (<I>1</I>) if the food is prepared from unconcentrated, undiluted liquid extracted from mature lemons; or (<I>2</I>) if the food is prepared from unconcentrated, undiluted liquid extracted from mature lemons to which concentrated lemon juice is added to adjust acidity as provided for in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) “Lemon juice from concentrate” or “reconstituted lemon juice” (<I>1</I>) if the food is prepared from concentrated lemon juice and water and/or lemon juice; or (<I>2</I>) if the food is prepared from lemon juice from concentrate and lemon juice. The words “from concentrate” or “reconstituted” shall be shown in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the word “lemon juice.”
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Label declaration.</I> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(b) [Reserved]
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Fill of container.</I> (1) The standard of fill of container for lemon juice, except when the food is frozen, is not less than 90 percent of the total capacity of the container as determined by the general method for fill of container prescribed in § 130.12(b) of this chapter, except 
</P>
<P>(i) When the food is frozen or 
</P>
<P>(ii) When the food is packaged in individual serving-size packages, containing 
<FR>1/2</FR> fluid ounce or less, for use as described in § 1.24(a)(3) of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(2) Compliance is determined as specified in § 146.3(g)(2).
</P>
<P>(3) If the lemon juice fails to meet the standard of fill as prescribed in paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein prescribed.

<HEAD>§ 178.3297   Colorants for polymers.</HEAD>
<P>The substances listed in paragraph (e) of this section may be safely used as colorants in the manufacture of articles or components of articles intended for use in producing, manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food, subject to the provisions and definitions set forth in this section:
</P>
<P>(a) The term <I>colorant</I> means a dye, pigment, or other substance that is used to impart color to or to alter the color of a food-contact material, but that does not migrate to food in amounts that will contribute to that food any color apparent to the naked eye. For the purpose of this section, the term “colorant” includes substances such as optical brighteners and fluorescent whiteners, which may not themselves be colored, but whose use is intended to affect the color of a food-contact material.
</P>
<P>(b) The colorant must be used in accordance with current good manufacturing practice, including use levels which are not in excess of those reasonably required to accomplish the intended coloring effect.
</P>
<P>(c) Colorants in this section must conform to the description and specifications indicated. If a polymer described in this section is itself the subject of a regulation promulgated under section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, it shall also comply with any specifications and limitations prescribed by that regulation. Extraction testing guidelines to conduct studies for additional uses of colorants under this section are available from the Food and Drug Administration free of charge from the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, 240-402-1200
</P>
<P>(d) Color additives and their lakes listed for direct use in foods, under the provisions of the color additive regulations in parts 73, 74, 81, and 82 of this chapter, may also be used as colorants for food-contact polymers.
</P>

<EXTRACT>
<HD1>general instructions
</HD1>
<P>Because of the sensitivity of the test, the possibility of errors arising from contamination is great. It is of the greatest importance that all glassware be scrupulously cleaned to remove all organic matter such as oil, grease, detergent residues, etc. Examine all glassware, including stoppers and stopcocks, under ultraviolet light to detect any residual fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care to avoid contamination of oil samples in handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate packaging is essential. Because some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this test are very susceptible to photo-oxidation, the entire procedure is to be carried out under subdued light.

<P>Before proceeding with analysis of a sample, determine the absorbance in a 5-centimeter path cell between 250 millimicrons and 400 millimicrons for the reagent blank by carrying out the procedure, without an oil sample, recording the spectra after the extraction stage and after the complete procedure as prescribed. The absorbance per centimeter pathlength following the extraction stage should not exceed 0.02 in the wavelength range from 280 mµ to 400 mµ; the absorbance per centimeter pathlength following the complete procedure should not exceed 0.02 in the wavelength range from 280 mµ to 400 mµ. If in either spectrum the characteristic benzene peaks in the 250 mµ-260 mµ region are present, remove the benzene by the procedure under “Organic solvents” and record absorbance again.
</P>
<P>Place 300 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 1-liter separatory funnel and add 75 milliliters of phosphoric acid. Mix the contents of the funnel and allow to stand for 10 minutes. (The reaction between the sulfoxide and the acid is exothermic. Release pressure after mixing, then keep funnel stoppered.) Add 150 milliliters of isooctane and shake to pre-equilibrate the solvents. Draw off the individual layers and store in glass-stoppered flasks.
</P>
<P>Weigh a 20-gram sample of the oil and transfer to a 500-milliliter separatory funnel containing 100 milliliters of pre-equilibrated sulfoxide-phosphoric acid mixture. Complete the transfer of the sample with small portions of preequilibrated isooctane to give a total volume of the oil and solvent of 75 milliliters. Shake the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes. Set up three 250-milliliter separatory funnels with each containing 30 milliliters of pre-equilibrated isooctane. After separation of liquid phases, carefully draw off lower layer into the first 250-milliliter separatory funnel and wash in tandem with the 30-milliliter portions of isooctane contained in the 250-milliliter separatory funnels. Shaking time for each wash is 1 minute. Repeat the extraction operation with two additional portions of the sulfoxide-acid mixture and wash each extractive in tandem through the same three portions of isooctane.
</P>
<P>Collect the successive extractives (300 milliliters total) in a separatory funnel (preferably 2-liter) containing 480 milliliters of distilled water; mix, and allow to cool for a few minutes after the last extractive has been added. Add 80 milliliters of isooctane to the solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes. Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second separatory funnel (preferably 2-liter) and repeat the extraction with 80 milliliters of isooctane. Draw off and discard the aqueous layer. Wash each of the 80-milliliter extractives three times with 100-milliliter portions of distilled water. Shaking time for each wash is 1 minute. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extractive through anhydrous sodium sulfate prewashed with isooctane (see Sodium sulfate under “Reagents and Materials” for preparation of filter) into a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into the evaporation flask). Wash the first separatory funnel with the second 80-milliliter isooctane extractive and pass through the sodium sulfate. Then wash the second and first separatory funnels successively with a 20-milliliter portion of isooctane and pass the solvent through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Add 1 milliliter of <I>n</I>-hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under nitrogen. Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 milliliter of residue remains. To the residue, add a 10-milliliter portion of isooctane, reevaporate to 1 milliliter of hexadecane, and repeat this operation once.
</P>
<P>Quantitatively transfer the residue with isooctane to a 200-milliliter volumetric flask, make to volume, and mix. Determine the absorbance of the solution in the 1-centimeter pathlength cells compared to isooctane as reference between 280 mµ-400 mµ (take care to lose none of the solution in filling the sample cell). Correct the absorbance values for any absorbance derived from reagents as determined by carrying out the procedure without an oil sample. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits prescribed in this paragraph, the oil meets the ultraviolet absorbance specifications. If the corrected absorbance per centimeter pathlength exceeds the limits prescribed in this paragraph, proceed as follows: Quantitatively transfer the isooctane solution to a 125-milliliter flask equipped with 24/40 joint, and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under a stream of nitrogen to a volume of 1 milliliter of hexadecane. Add 10 milliliters of methyl alcohol and approximately 0.3 gram of sodium borohydride. (Minimize exposure of the borohydride to the atmosphere. A measuring dipper may be used.) Immediately fit a water-cooled condenser equipped with a 24/40 joint and with a drying tube into the flask, mix until the borohydride is dissolved, and allow to stand for 30 minutes at room temperature, with intermittent swirling. At the end of this period, disconnect the flask and evaporate the methyl alcohol on the steam bath under nitrogen until the sodium borohydride begins to come out of the solution. Then add 10 milliliters of isooctane and evaporate to a volume of about 2-3 milliliters. Again, add 10 milliliters of isooctane and concentrate to a volume of approximately 5 milliliters. Swirl the flask repeatedly to assure adequate washing of the sodium borohydride residues.
</P>
<P>Fit the tetrafluoroethylene polymer disc on the upper part of the stem of the chromatographic tube, then place the tube with the disc on the suction flask and apply the vacuum (approximately 135 millimeters Hg pressure). Weigh out 14 grams of the 2:1 magnesium oxide-Celite 545 mixture and pour the adsorbent mixture into the chromatographic tube in approximately 3-centimeter layers. After the addition of each layer, level off the top of the adsorbent with a flat glass rod or metal plunger by pressing down firmly until the adsorbent is well packed. Loosen the topmost few millimeters of each adsorbent layer with the end of a metal rod before the addition of the next layer. Continue packing in this manner until all the 14 grams of the adsorbent is added to the tube. Level off the top of the adsorbent by pressing down firmly with a flat glass rod or metal plunger to make the depth of the adsorbent bed approximately 12.5 centimeters in depth. Turn off the vacuum and remove the suction flask. Fit the 500-milliliter reservoir onto the top of the chromatographic column and prewet the column by passing 100 milliliters of isooctane through the column. Adjust the nitrogen pressure so that the rate of descent of the isooctane coming off the column is between 2-3 milliliters per minute. Discontinue pressure just before the last of the isooctane reaches the level of the adsorbent. (Caution: Do not allow the liquid level to recede below the adsorbent level at any time.) Remove the reservoir and decant the 5-milliliter isooctane concentrate solution onto the column and with slight pressure again allow the liquid level to recede to barely above the adsorbent level. Rapidly complete the transfer similarly with two 5-milliliter portions of isooctane, swirling the flask repeatedly each time to assure adequate washing of the residue. Just before the final 5-milliliter wash reaches the top of the adsorbent, add 100 milliliters of isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at the 2-3 milliliters per minute rate. Just before the last of the isooctane reaches the adsorbent level, add 100 milliliters of 10 percent benzene in isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at the aforementioned rate. Just before the solvent mixture reaches adsorbent level, add 25 milliliters of 20 percent benzene in isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at 2-3 milliliters per minute until all this solvent mixture has been removed from the column. Discard all the elution solvents collected up to this point. Add 300 milliliters of the acetone-benzene-water mixture to the reservoir and percolate through the column to eluate the polynuclear compounds. Collect the eluate in a clean 1-liter separatory funnel. Allow the column to drain until most of the solvent mixture is removed. Wash the eluate three times with 300-milliliter portions of distilled water, shaking well for each wash. (The addition of small amounts of sodium chloride facilitates separation.) Discard the aqueous layer after each wash. After the final separation, filter the residual benzene through anhydrous sodium sulfate pre-washed with benzene (see Sodium sulfate under “Reagents and Materials” for preparation of filter) into a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into the evaporation flask). Wash the separatory funnel with two additional 20-milliliter portions of benzene which are also filtered through the sodium sulfate. Add 1 milliliter of <I>n</I>-hexadecane and completely remove the benzene by evaporation under nitrogen, using the special procedure to eliminate benzene as previously described under “Organic solvents.” Quantitatively transfer the residue with isooctane to a 200-milliliter volumetric flask and adjust to volume. Determine the absorbance of the solution in the 1-centimeter pathlength cells compared to isooctane as reference between 250 mµ-400 mµ. Correct for any absorbance derived from the reagents as determined by carrying out the procedure without an oil sample. If either spectrum shows the characteristic benzene peaks in the 250 mµ-260 mµ region, evaporate the solution to remove benzene by the procedure under “Organic solvents.” Dissolve the residue, transfer quantitatively, and adjust to volume in isooctane in a 200-milliliter volumetric flask. Record the absorbance again. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits proposed in this paragraph, the oil meets the proposed ultraviolet absorbance specifications.</P></EXTRACT>

</P>
<P>4. <I>Silica gel.</I> 100-200 mesh (Davison Chemical, Baltimore, Md., Grade 923, or equivalent), purified and activated by the following procedure: Place about 1 kilogram of silica gel in a large column and wash with contaminant-free benzene until a 200-milliliter sample of the benzene coming off the column will pass the ultraviolet absorption test for benzene. This test is performed as stipulated under “Organic solvents” in A under III above. When the silica gel has been sufficiently cleaned, activate the gel before use by placing the 1-kilogram batch in a shallow container in a layer no greater than 1 inch in depth and heating in an oven (Caution! Explosion Hazard) at 130 °C. for 16 hours, and store in a vacuum desiccator. Reheating about once a week is necessary if the silica gel is repeatedly removed from the desiccator. 
</P>
<P>5. <I>Aluminum oxide</I> (<I>Aluminum Co. of America, Grade F-20, or equivalent grade</I>). 80-200 mesh, purified and activated by the following procedure: Place about 1 kilogram of aluminum oxide in a large column and wash with contaminant-free benzene until a 200-milliliter sample of the benzene coming off the column will pass the ultraviolet absorption test for benzene. This test is performed as stipulated under “Organic solvents” in A under III above. (Caution! Remove Benzene From Adsorbent Under Vacuum To Minimize Explosion Hazard in Subsequent Heating!) When the aluminum oxide has been sufficiently cleaned and freed of solvent, activate it before use by placing the 1-kilogram batch in a shallow container in a layer no greater than 1 inch in depth. Heat in an oven at 130 °C for 16 hours. Upon removal from heat, store at atmospheric pressure over 80 percent (by weight) sulfuric acid in a desiccator for at least 36 hours before use. This gives aluminum oxide with between 6 to 9.5 percent volatiles. This is determined by heating a weighed sample of the prepared aluminum oxide at 2,000 °F for 2 hours and then quickly reweighing. To insure the proper adsorptive properties of the aluminum oxide, perform the following test:
</P>
<P>a. Weigh 50 grams ±1 gram of the activated aluminum oxide and pack into the chromatographic column (1.3 centimeters × 75 centimeters) described under “Apparatus” in C under I above. Use glass wool at the column exit to prevent the aluminum oxide from passing through the column.
</P>
<P>b. Place a 250-milliliter graduated cylinder under the column to measure the amount of eluate coming from the column.
</P>
<P>c. Prewet the aluminum oxide by passing 40 milliliters of isooctane through the column. Adjust the nitrogen pressure so that the rate of descent of the isooctane coming off the column is between 1.5 to 2.5 milliliters per minute.
</P>
<P>d. Just prior to the last of the isooctane reaching the top of the aluminum oxide bed, add 10 milliliters of the isooctane solution containing 5.0 milligrams of chrysene per liter.
</P>
<P>e. Continue percolation until the isooctane is just above the aluminum oxide. Then add 200 milliliters of a mixture of benzene and isooctane (33
<FR>1/3</FR> percent benzene and 66
<FR>2/3</FR> percent isooctane by volume) to the reservoir and continue percolation.
</P>
<P>f. Continue percolation, collecting the eluates (40 milliliters of the prewet solution, 10 milliliters of the sample solution, and 200 milliliters of the gradient solution) in the 250-milliliter graduated cylinder until the level of the gradient solution is just above the aluminum oxide. Add 200 milliliters of the eluting solution of benzene and isooctane (90 percent benzene and 10 percent isooctane by volume) to the column and continue collecting until a total of 250 milliliters of solution has been obtained. This may be discarded. Now begin to collect the final eluate.
</P>
<P>g. Place a 100-milliliter graduated cylinder under the column and continue the percolation until a 100-milliliter eluate has been obtained.
</P>
<P>h. Measure the amount of chrysene in this 100-milliliter fraction by ultraviolet analysis. If the aluminum oxide is satisfactory, more than 80 percent of the original amount of chrysene should be found in this fraction. (<E T="04">Note:</E> If the amount of chrysene recovered is less than 80 percent, the original batch of aluminum oxide should be sieved between 100-160 mesh. Activation and testing of this sieved batch should indicate a satisfactory aluminum oxide for use.)
</P>
<P>IV. <I>Sampling.</I> Precautions must be taken to insure that an uncontaminated sample of the mineral oil is obtained since ultraviolet absorption is very sensitive to small amounts of extraneous material contaminating the sample through careless handling.
</P>
<P>V. <I>Procedure.</I> A. <I>Blank.</I> Before proceeding with the analysis of a sample, determine the absorbance of the solvent residues by carrying out the procedure without a sample.
</P>
<P>B. <I>Sample.</I> 1. Weigh out 20.0 grams ±0.1 gram of the mineral oil into a beaker and transfer to a 250-milliliter separatory funnel fitted with a tetrafluoroethylene polymer stopcock, using enough cyclohexane (25 milliliters) to give a final total volume of 50 milliliters (mineral oil plus cyclohexane).
</P>
<P>2. Add 25 milliliters of nitromethane saturated with cyclohexane and shake by hand vigorously for 3 minutes. Recover the lower nitromethane layer in a 150-milliliter beaker containing 1 milliliter of <I>n</I>-hexadecane and evaporate on the steam bath under nitrogen. Repeat the extraction four more times, recovering each extract in the 150-milliliter beaker. Exercise care not to fill the beaker to such a capacity that solvent losses may occur. Evaporate the combined nitromethane extracts to 1 milliliter of <I>n</I>-hexadecane residue containing the nitromethane-soluble mineral oil extractives. (<E T="04">Note:</E> Complete removal of the nitromethane is essential. This can be assured by two successive additions of 5 milliliters of isooctane and reevaporation.)
</P>
<P>3. Remove the beaker from the steam bath and allow to cool.
</P>
<P>4. Weigh 50 grams ±1 gram of activated aluminum oxide and pack into the chromatographic column (1.3 centimeters × 75 centimeters) described under “Apparatus” in C under I above. (<E T="04">Note:</E> A small plug of glass wool is placed at the column exit to prevent the aluminum oxide from passing through the column. After adding aluminum oxide, tap the column lightly to remove air voids. All percolations using aluminum oxide are performed under nitrogen pressure. The 500-milliliter reservoir described under “Apparatus” in E under I above is to be used to hold the elution solvents.)
</P>
<P>5. Prewet the column by adding 40 milliliters of isooctane to the column. Adjust nitrogen pressure so that rate of descent of the isooctane coming off the column is 2.0 to 3.0 milliliters per minute. Be careful to maintain the level of solvent in the reservoir to prevent air from entering the aluminum oxide bed. New or additional solvent is added just before the last portion of the previous solvent enters the bed. To minimize possible photo-oxidation effects, the following procedures (steps 6 through 18) shall be carried out in subdued light.
</P>
<P>6. Before the last of the isooctane reaches the top of the aluminum oxide bed, release the nitrogen pressure and turn off the stopcock on the column. Transfer the <I>n</I>-hexadecane residue from the 150-milliliter beaker from procedure step 3 above onto the column, using several washes of isooctane (total volume of washes should be no greater than 10-15 milliliters).
</P>
<P>7. Open the stopcock and continue percolation until the isooctane is about 1 centimeter above the top of the aluminum oxide bed. Add 200 milliliters of isooctane to the reservoir, and continue the percolation at the specified rate.
</P>
<P>8. Just before the isooctane surface reaches the top of the aluminum oxide bed, add 200 milliliters of a mixture of benzene and isooctane (33
<FR>1/3</FR> percent benzene and 66
<FR>2/3</FR> percent isooctane by volume) to the reservoir, and continue the percolation.
</P>
<P>9. Just before the surface of this mixture reaches the top of the aluminum oxide bed, release the nitrogen pressure, turn off the stopcock, and discard all the elution solvents collected up to this point.
</P>
<P>10. Add to the reservoir 300 milliliters of a mixture of benzene and isooctane (90 percent benzene and 10 percent isooctane by volume), place a 25-milliliter graduated cylinder under the column, continue the percolation until 20 milliliters of eluate has been collected, and then discard the eluate.
</P>
<P>11. At this point, place a clean 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask under the column. Continue the percolation and collect all the remaining eluate.
</P>
<P>(<E T="04">Note:</E> Allow the column to drain completely. An increase in the nitrogen pressure may be necessary as the last of the solvent comes off the column.)
</P>
<P>12. Place 1 milliliter of <I>n</I>-hexadecane into a 150-milliliter beaker. Place this onto a steam bath under a nitrogen stream and transfer in small portions the eluate from step 11 above. Wash out the Erlenmeyer flask with small amounts of benzene and transfer to the evaporation beaker. Evaporate until only 1 milliliter of hexadecane residue remains. (<E T="04">Note:</E> Complete removal of the benzene is essential. This can be assured by two successive additions of 5 milliliters of isooctane and reevaporation.)
</P>
<P>13. Remove the beaker from the steam bath and cool.
</P>
<P>14. Place a sample of 113.5 grams activated 100- 200-mesh silica gel in a 500-milliliter glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer flask. Add to the silica gel 46.2 grams (41 milliliters) of nitromethane. Stopper and shake the flask vigorously until no lumps of silica gel are observed and then shake occasionally during a period of 1 hour. The resultant nitromethane-treated silica gel is 29 weight-percent nitro-methane and 71 weight-percent silica gel.
</P>
<P>15. Place a small plug of glass wool in the tapered end of the 1.7 centimeters outside diameter × 115 centimeters column, described under “Apparatus” in D of I above, adjacent to the stopcock to prevent silica gel from passing through the stopcock. Pack the nitromethane-treated silica gel into the column, tapping lightly. The resultant silica gel bed should be about 95 centimeters in depth. Place into a flask 170 milliliters of isooctane saturated with nitromethane.
</P>
<P>16. Place a 100-milliliter graduated cylinder under the column and transfer the residue from the beaker in procedure step 13 above with several washes of the 170 milliliters of isooctane, saturated with nitromethane, onto the top of the column. (Total volume of washes should be no greater than 10 to 15 milliliters.) Permit isooctane solution to enter the silica gel bed until the liquid level is at the top bed level. Place the remaining amount of the 170 milliliters of isooctane, saturated with nitromethane, in the reservoir above the bed for percolation through the silica gel. Apply nitrogen pressure to the top of the column, adjusting the pressure so that the isooctane is collected at the rate of 2.5 to 3.5 milliliters per minute, and percolate isooctane through the bed until a quantity of 75.0 milliliters of eluate is collected. Discard the 75 milliliters of eluate. Turn off the stopcock and add 250 milliliters of benzene to the reservoir above the bed. Use a 400-milliliter beaker to collect the remaining eluate.
</P>
<P>17. Open the stopcock, renew the pressure, and percolate the remaining isooctane and benzene through the column eluting the remaining aromatics. Transfer the eluate in small portions from the 400 milliliter beaker to a 150-milliliter beaker containing 1 milliliter of <I>n</I>-hexadecane and evaporate on the steam bath under nitrogen. Rinse the 400-milliliter beaker well with small portions of isooctane to obtain a complete transfer.
</P>
<P>(<E T="04">Note:</E> Complete removal of the nitromethane and benzene is essential. This can be assured by successive additions of 5 milliliters of isooctane and reevaporation.)
</P>
<P>18. Transfer the residue with several washes of isooctane into a 200-milliliter volumetric flask. Add isooctane to mark. 
</P>
<P>19. Record the spectrum of the sample solution in a 1-centimeter cell compared to isooctane from 270 to 400 mµ. After making necessary corrections in the spectrum for cell differences and for the blank absorbance, record the maximum absorbance in each of the wavelength intervals (mµ), 280-299, 300-319, 320-359, 360-400.
</P>
<P>a. If the spectrum then shows no discernible peak corresponding to the absorbance maximum of the pyrene reference standard solution at 334 mµ, the maximum absorbances in the respective wavelength intervals recorded shall not exceed those prescribed in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
</P>
<P>b. If such a peak is evident in the spectrum of the sample solution, and the spectrum as a whole is not incompatible with that of a pyrene contaminant yielding such a peak of the observed absorbance, calculate the concentration of pyrene that would yield this peak (334 m) by the base-line technique described in ASTM method E169-63 (Reapproved 1981), “Standard Recommended Practices for General Techniques of Ultraviolet Quantitative Analysis,” which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Correct each of the maximum absorbances in the respective specified wavelength intervals by subtracting the absorbance due to pyrene, determined as follows:
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er01ja93.407.gif"/>
<FP>where:
</FP>
<FP-2>Cp = Calculated concentration of pyrene in sample solution;
</FP-2>
<FP-2>Sp = Concentration of pyrene reference standard solution in same units of concentration;
</FP-2>
<FP-2>Sa = Absorbance of pyrene reference standard solution at wavelength of maximum absorbance of sample solution in the respective specified wavelength intervals.
</FP-2>
<P>Also calculate the pyrene content of the oil sample in parts per million as follows:
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er01ja93.408.gif"/>
<FP>where:
</FP>
<FP-2>C = Calculated concentration of pyrene in milligrams per liter of sample solution.
</FP-2>
<P>c. The pyrene content so determined shall not exceed 25 p.p.m. The maximum absorbances corrected for pyrene content as described in this step 19 for each of the specified wavelength intervals shall not exceed the limits prescribed in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
</P>
<P>d. If the spectrum as a whole of the sample solution is in any respect clearly incompatible with the presence of pyrene as the source of the peak at 334 mµ, then the maximum absorbances in the respective wavelength intervals without correction for any assumed pyrene content shall not exceed the limits prescribed in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.</P></EXTRACT>

<HD1>general instructions
</HD1>
<P>Because of the sensitivity of the test, the possibility of errors arising from contamination is great. It is of the greatest importance that all glassware be scrupulously cleaned to remove all organic matter such as oil, grease, detergent residues, etc. Examine all glassware, including stoppers and stopcocks, under ultraviolet light to detect any residual fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care to avoid contamination of wax samples in handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate packaging is essential. Because some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this test are very susceptible to photo-oxidation, the entire procedure is to be carried out under subdued light.

<HD1>reagents and materials
</HD1>
<P><I>Organic solvents.</I> All solvents used throughout the procedure shall meet the specifications and tests described in this specification. The isooctane and benzene designated in the list following this paragraph shall pass the following test:
</P>
<P>To be specified quantity of solvent in a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask, add 1 milliliter of purified <I>n</I>-hexadecane and evaporate on the steam bath under a stream of nitrogen (a loose aluminum foil jacket around the flask will speed evaporation). Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 milliliter of residue remains. (To the residue from benzene add a 10-milliliter portion of purified isooctane, reevaporate, and repeat once to insure complete removal of benzene.)
</P>
<P>Alternatively, the evaporation time can be reduced by using the optional evaporation flask. In this case the solvent and <I>n</I>-hexadecane are placed in the flask on the steam bath, the tube assembly is inserted, and a stream of nitrogen is fed through the inlet tube while the outlet tube is connected to a solvent trap and vacuum line in such a way as to prevent any flow-back of condensate into the flask.
</P>
<P>Dissolve the 1 milliliter of hexadecane residue in isooctane and make up to 25 milliliters volume. Determine the absorbance in the 1-centimeter pathlength cells compared to isooctane as reference. The absorbance of the solution of the solvent residue (except for methyl alcohol) shall not exceed 0.01 per centimeter pathlength between 280 mµ and 400 mµ. 
</P>
<P><I>Isooctane</I> (<I>2,2,4-trimethylpentane</I>). Use 180 milliliters for the test described in the preceding paragraph. Purify, if necessary, by passage through a column of activated silica gel (Grade 12, Davison Chemical Co., Baltimore, Md., or equivalent) about 90 centimeters in length and 5 centimeters to 8 centimeters in diameter.
</P>
<P><I>Benzene, A.C.S. reagent grade.</I> Use 150 milliliters for the test. Purify, if necessary, by distillation or otherwise.
</P>
<P><I>n-Hexadecane, 99 percent olefin-free.</I> Dilute 1.0 milliliter of <I>n</I>-hexadecane to 25 milliliters with isooctane and determine the absorbance in a 1-centimeter cell compared to isooctane as reference point between 280 mµ-400 mµ. The absorbance per centimeter pathlength shall not exceed 0.00 in this range. If necessary, purify by filtering through a column containing 100 grams of aluminum oxide (use same grade as described below) in the lower half and 100 grams of activated silica gel in the upper half keeping the column at 150 °C., for a period of 15 hours or overnight. The first 100 milliliters of eluate are used. Purification can also be accomplished by distillation.
</P>
<P><I>Dimethyl sulfoxide.</I> Pure grade, clear, water-white, m.p. 18° minimum. Dilute 120 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide with 240 milliliters of distilled water in a 500-milliliter separatory funnel, mix and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes. Add 40 milliliters of isooctane to the solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes. Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second 500-milliliter separatory funnel and repeat the extraction with 40 milliliters of isooctane. Draw off and discard the aqueous layer. Wash each of the 40-milliliter extractives three times with 50-milliliter portions of distilled water. Shaking time for each wash is 1 minute. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extractive through anhydrous sodium sulfate prewashed with isooctane (see <I>Sodium sulfate</I> under “Reagents and materials” for preparation of filter), into a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask, or optionally into the evaporating flask. Wash the first separatory funnel with the second 40-milliliter isooctane extractive, and pass through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Then wash the second and first separatory funnels successively with a 10-milliliter portion of isooctane, and pass the solvent through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Add 1 milliliter of <I>n</I>-hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under nitrogen. Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 milliliter of residue remains. To the residue, add a 10-milliliter portion of isooctane and reevaporate to 1 milliliter of hexadecane. Again, add 10 milliliters of isooctane to the residue and evaporate to 1 milliliter of hexadecane to insure complete removal of all volatile materials. Dissolve the 1 milliliter of hexadecane in isooctane and make to 25-milliliter volume. Determine the absorbance in 1-centimeter pathlength cells compared to isooctane as reference. The absorbance of the solution should not exceed 0.02 per centimeter pathlength in the 280 mµ-400 mµ range. (<E T="04">Note:</E> Difficulty in meeting this absorbance specification may be due to organic impurities in the distilled water. Repetition of the test omitting the dimethyl sulfoxide will disclose their presence. If necessary to meet the specification, purify the water by redistillation, passage through an ion-exchange resin, or otherwise.)
</P>
<P>Purify, if necessary, by the following procedure: To 1,500 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 2-liter glass-stoppered flask, add 6.0 milliliters of phosphoric acid and 50 grams of Norit A (decolorizing carbon, alkaline) or equivalent. Stopper the flask, and with the use of a magnetic stirrer (tetrafluoroethylene polymer coated bar) stir the solvent for 15 minutes. Filter the dimethyl sulfoxide through four thicknesses of fluted paper (18.5 centimeters, Schleicher &amp; Schuell, No. 597, or equivalent). If the initial filtrate contains carbon fines, refilter through the same filter until a clear filtrate is obtained. Protect the sulfoxide from air and moisture during this operation by covering the solvent in the funnel and collection flask with a layer of isooctane. Transfer the filtrate to a 2-liter separatory funnel and draw off the dimethyl sulfoxide into the 2-liter distillation flask of the vacuum distillation assembly and distill at approximately 3-millimeter Hg pressure or less. Discard the first 200-milliliter fraction of the distillate and replace the distillate collection flask with a clean one. Continue the distillation until approximately 1 liter of the sulfoxide has been collected.
</P>
<P>At completion of the distillation, the reagent should be stored in glass-stoppered bottles since it is very hygroscopic and will react with some metal containers in the presence of air.
</P>
<P><I>Phosphoric acid.</I> 85 percent A.C.S. reagent grade.
</P>
<P><I>Aluminum oxide</I> (<I>80-200 mesh Woelm neutral activity grade 1</I> [<I>Brockmann</I>], <I>Alupharm Chemicals, New Orleans, La., or equivalent</I>). Pipette 1 milliliter of distilled water into a dry 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a ground-glass stopper. Stopper the flask and rotate it in such a manner as to completely wet out the inside surfaces. When this has been done add 180 grams of the aluminum oxide and shake until no lumps or wet spots remain. Allow to stand at room temperature for a period of 2 hours. At the end of this time the water should be evenly distributed throughout the aluminum oxide powder, and it should have the same free flowing properties as the original material (flow velocity with water 0.2 milliliter per minute). At this point the aluminum oxide has an activity of 1 as expressed in Brockmann degrees, and the amount of added water is 0.5 percent by volume. This product is used in toto and as is, without further screening.
</P>
<P><I>Sodium sulfate, anhydrous, A.C.S. reagent grade, preferably in granular form.</I> For each bottle of sodium sulfate reagent used, establish as follows the necessary sodium sulfate prewash to provide such filters required in the method: Place approximately 35 grams of anhydrous sodium sulfate in a 30-milliliter coarse, fritted-glass funnel or in a 65-millimeter filter funnel with glass wool plug; wash with successive 15-milliliter portions of the indicated solvent until a 15-milliliter portion of the wash shows 0.00 absorbance per centimeter pathlength between 280 mµ and 400 mµ when tested as prescribed under “Organic solvents.” Usually three portions of wash solvent are sufficient.

<P>Before proceeding with analysis of a sample, determine the absorbance in a 1-centimeter path cell between 250 mµ and 400 mµ for the reagent blank by carrying out the procedure, without a wax sample, at room temperature, recording the spectrum after the complete procedure as prescribed. The absorbance per centimeter pathlength following the complete procedure should not exceed 0.04 in the wavelength range from 280 mµ to 299 mµ, inclusive, nor 0.02 in the wavelength range from 300 mµ to 400 mµ. If in either spectrum the characteristic benzene peaks in the 250 mµ-260 mµ region are present, remove the benzene by the procedure under “Organic solvents” and record absorbance again. Place 300 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 1-liter separatory funnel and add 75 milliliters of phosphoric acid. Mix the contents of the funnel and allow to stand for 10 minutes. (The reaction between the sulfoxide and the acid is exothermic. Release pressure after mixing, then keep funnel stoppered.) Add 150 milliliters of isooctane and shake to preequilibrate the solvents. Draw off the individual layers and store in glass-stoppered flasks.
</P>
<P>In a 1-liter separatory funnel place a representative 25-gram sample of wax, add 50 milliliters of isooctane, heat gently, stir until the wax is in solution; add 100 milliliters of preequilibrated sulfoxide-phosphoric acid mixture and shake, making sure it remains in solution. If the wax comes out of solution during these operations, let the stoppered funnel remain in the jacket until the wax redissolves. (Remove stopper from the funnel at intervals to release pressure.) When the wax is in solution, remove the funnel from the jacket and shake it vigorously for 2 minutes. Set up three 250-milliliter separatory funnels with each containing 30 milliliters of preequilibrated isooctane. After separation of the liquid phases, allow to cool until the main portion of the wax-isooctane solution begins to show a precipitate. Gently swirl the funnel when precipitation first occurs on the inside surface of the funnel to accelerate this process. Carefully draw off the lower layer, filter it slowly through a thin layer of glass wool fitted loosely in a filter funnel into the first 250-milliliter separatory funnel, and wash in tandem with the 30-milliliter portions of isooctane contained in the 250-milliliter separatory funnels. Shaking time for each wash is 1 minute. Repeat the extraction operation with two additional portions of the sulfoxide-acid mixture, replacing the funnel in the jacket after each extraction to keep the wax in solution and washing each extractive in tandem through the same three portions of isooctane.
</P>
<P>Collect the successive extractives (300 milliliters total) in a separatory funnel (preferably 2-liter), containing 480 milliliters of distilled water, mix, and allow to cool for a few minutes after the last extractive has been added. Add 80 milliliters of isooctane to the solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes. Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second separatory funnel (preferably 2-liter) and repeat the extraction with 80 milliliters of isooctane. Draw off and discard the aqueous layer. Wash each of the 80-milliliter extractives three times with 100-milliliter portions of distilled water. Shaking time for each wash is 1 minute. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extractive through anhydrous sodium sulfate prewashed with isooctane (see <I>Sodium sulfate</I> under “Reagents and Materials” for preparation of filter) into a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into the evaporation flask). Wash the first separatory funnel with the second 80-milliliter isooctane extractive and pass through the sodium sulfate. Then wash the second and first separatory funnels successively with a 20-milliliter portion of isooctane and pass the solvent through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Add 1 milliliter of <I>n</I>-hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane using an aspirator vacuum under nitrogen and in an oil bath temperature of approximately 90 °C. Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 milliliter of residue remains. To the residue, add a 10-milliliter portion of isooctane, reevaporate to 1 milliliter of hexadecane, and repeat this operation once.
</P>
<P>Reserve the residue for column chromatography on the aluminum oxide. Fit the tetrafluoroethylene polymer disc on the upper part of the stem of the chromatographic tube, then place the tube with the disc on the suction flask and apply the vacuum (approximately 135 millimeters Hg pressure). Weigh out 180 grams of the aluminum oxide and pour the adsorbent mixture into the chromatographic tube in approximately 30-centimeter layers. After the addition of each layer, level off the top of the adsorbent with a flat glass rod or metal plunger by pressing down firmly until the adsorbent is well packed. Loosen the topmost few millimeters of each adsorbent layer with the end of a metal rod before the addition of the next layer. Continue packing in this manner until all the 180 grams of the adsorbent is added to the tube. Level off the top of the adsorbent by pressing down firmly with a flat glass rod or metal plunger to make the depth of the adsorbent bed approximately 80 centimeters in depth. Turn off the vacuum and remove the suction flask. Dissolve the hexadecane residue in 10 milliliters of warm benzene and decant the solution onto the column and allow the liquid level to recede to barely above the adsorbent level. Rapidly complete the transfer similarly with two 10-milliliter portions of benzene swirling the flask repeatedly each time to assure adequate washing of the residue. Fix the 1,000-milliliter reservoir onto the top of the chromatographic column. Just before the final 10-milliliter wash reaches the top of the adsorbent, add 670 milliliters of benzene to the reservoir and continue the percolation at the 2-3 milliliter per minute rate until a total of 670 milliliters of benzene has been utilized. Collect the eluate in a clean 1-liter Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into a 1-liter evaporation flask). Allow the column to drain until most of the solvent mixture is removed. Add 1 milliliter of <I>n</I>-hexadecane and completely remove the benzene by evaporation under nitrogen, using the special procedure to eliminate benzene as previously described under “Organic Solvents.” Quantitatively transfer the residue with isooctane to a 25-milliliter volumetric flask and adjust to volume. Determine the absorbance of the solution in the 1-centimeter pathlength cells compared to isooctane as reference between 250 mµ-400 mµ. Correct for any absorbance derived from the reagents as determined by carrying out the procedure without a wax sample. If either spectrum shows the characteristic benzene peaks in the 250 mµ-260 mµ region, evaporate the solution to remove benzene by the procedure under “Organic Solvents.” Dissolve the residue, transfer quantitatively, and adjust to volume in isooctane in a 25-milliliter volumetric flask. Record the absorbance again. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, the wax meets the ultraviolet absorbance specifications.</P></EXTRACT>

<HD1>general instructions
</HD1>
<P>Because of the sensitivity of the test, the possibility of errors arising from contamination is great. It is of the greatest importance that all glassware be scrupulously cleaned to remove all organic matter such as oil, grease, detergent, residues, etc. Examine all glassware including stoppers and stopcocks, under ultraviolet light to detect any residual fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care to avoid contamination of oil samples in handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate packaging is essential. Because some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this test are very susceptible to photo-oxidation, the entire procedure is to be carried out under subdued light.

</P>
<P><I>Sodium sulfate, anhydrous, A.C.S. reagent grade, preferably in granular form.</I> For each bottle of sodium sulfate reagent used, establish as follows the necessary sodium sulfate prewash to provide such filters required in the method: Place approximately 35 grams of anhydrous sodium sulfate in a 30-milliliter coarse, fritted-glass funnel or in a 65-milliliter filter funnel with glass wool plug; wash with successive 15-milliliter portions of the indicated solvent until a 15-milliliter portion of the wash shows 0.00 absorbance per centimeter path length between 280 mµ and 400 mµ when tested as prescribed under “Organic solvents.” Usually three portions of wash solvent are sufficient.
</P>
<P>Before proceeding with analysis of a sample, determine the absorbance in a 5-centimeter path cell between 250 millimicrons and 400 millimicrons for the reagent blank by carrying out the procedure, without a metal sample. The absorbance per centimeter path length should not exceed 0.02 in the wavelength range from 280 mµ to 400 mµ.
</P>
<P>Place 300 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 1-liter separatory funnel and add 75 milliliters of phosphoric acid. Mix the contents of the funnel and allow to stand for 10 minutes. (The reaction between the sulfoxide and the acid is exothermic. Release pressure after mixing, then keep funnel stoppered.) Add 150 milliliters of isooctane and shake to pre-equilibrate the solvents. Draw off the individual layers and store in glass-stoppered flasks.
</P>
<HD1>procedure
</HD1>
<P><I>Sample.</I> Select metal foil or sheet stock for the test which has not been previously contaminated by careless handling or exposure to atmospheric dust and fumes. A commercial coil in the form supplied for spindle mounting in a packaging line or wrapping machine is most suitable. Strip off the outside turn of metal and discard. Carefully avoid contamination or damage from handling the metal (wear gloves). Remove a 16-18-foot length from the coil and place it on a flat surface protected by a length of new kraft paper. Cut four 15-foot strips from the sample, each 3 inches wide (avoid tearing the edges of the strips). Using a piece of suitable glass rod, roll the strips of metal into loose coils and insert each into a Soxhlet thimble. Each turn of coil should be visibly separated from the adjacent turn.
</P>
<P><I>Extraction.</I> Fill each of the four Soxhlet tubes with purified isooctane (see under heading “Reagents and Materials,” above) until siphon action occurs and then refill the tube body. Supply heat to the boiling flask and allow extraction to continue for at least 8 hours or until repeated weighings of the dried and cooled coil show no further weight loss.
</P>
<P>Combine the isooctane extracts from the four Soxhlet units in a suitable beaker, rinsing each tube and flask into the beaker with fresh purified solvent. Evaporate the solvent under an atmosphere of inert gas (nitrogen) to residual volume of 50-60 milliliters and transfer this solution to a 500-milliliter separatory funnel containing 100 milliliters of pre-equilibrated sulfoxide-phosphoric acid mixture. Complete the transfer of the sample with small portions of pre-equilibrated isooctane to give a total volume of the residue and solvent of 75 milliliters. Shake the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes. Set up three 250-milliliter separatory funnels with each containing 30 milliliters of pre-equilibrated isooctane. After separation of liquid phases, carefully draw off lower layer into the first 250-milliliter separatory funnel and wash in tandem with the 30-milliliter portion of isooctane contained in the 250-milliliter separatory funnels. Shaking time for each wash is 1 minute. Repeat the extraction operation with two additional portions of the sulfoxide-acid mixture and wash each extractive in tandem through the same three portions of isooctane.
</P>
<P>Collect the successive extractives (300 milliliters total) in a separatory funnel (preferably 2-liter) containing 480 milliliters of distilled water; mix, and allow to cool for a few minutes after the last extractive has been added. Add 80 milliliters of isooctane to the solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes. Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second separatory funnel (preferably 2-liter) and repeat the extraction with 80 milliliter of isooctane. Draw off and discard the aqueous layer. Wash each of the 80 milliliter extractives three times with 100-milliliter portions distilled water. Shaking time for each wash is 1 minute. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extractive through anhydrous sodium sulfate pre-washed with isooctane (see sodium sulfate under “Reagents and Materials” for preparation of filter) into a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into the evaporation flask). Wash the first separatory funnel with the second 80-milliliter isooctane extractive and pass through the sodium sulfate. Then wash the second and first separatory funnels successively with a 20-milliliter portion of isooctane and pass the solvent through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Add 1 milliliter of <I>n</I>-hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under nitrogen. Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 milliliter of residue remains. To the residue, add a 10-milliliter portion of isooctane, reevaporate to 1 milliliter of hexadecane, and repeat this operation once.
</P>
<P>Quantitatively transfer the residue with isooctane to a 25-milliliter volumetric flask, make to volume, and mix. Determine the absorbance of the solution in 5-centimeter pathlength cells compared to isooctane as reference between 280mµ-400mµ (take care to lose none of the solution in filling the sample cell). Correct the absorbance values for any absorbance derived from reagents as determined by carrying out the procedure without a metal sample. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits prescribed in this paragraph, the residue meets the ultraviolet absorbance specifications.</P></EXTRACT>

<HEAD>§ 179.25   General provisions for food irradiation.</HEAD>
<P>For the purposes of § 179.26, current good manufacturing practice is defined to include the following restrictions:
</P>
<P>(a) Any firm that treats foods with ionizing radiation shall comply with the requirements of parts 110 and 117 of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
</P>
<P>(b) Food treated with ionizing radiation shall receive the minimum radiation dose reasonably required to accomplish its intended technical effect and not more than the maximum dose specified by the applicable regulation for that use.
</P>
<P>(c) Packaging materials subjected to irradiation incidental to the radiation treatment and processing of prepackaged food shall be in compliance with § 179.45, shall be the subject of an exemption for such use under § 170.39 of this chapter, or shall be the subject of an effective premarket notification for a food contact substance for such use submitted under § 170.100 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(d) Radiation treatment of food shall conform to a scheduled process. A scheduled process for food irradiation is a written procedure that ensures that the radiation dose range selected by the food irradiation processor is adequate under commercial processing conditions (including atmosphere and temperature) for the radiation to achieve its intended effect on a specific product and in a specific facility. A food irradiation processor shall operate with a scheduled process established by qualified persons having expert knowledge in radiation processing requirements of food and specific for that food and for that irradiation processor's treatment facility.
</P>
<P>(e) A food irradiation processor shall maintain records as specified in this section for a period of time that exceeds the shelf life of the irradiated food product by 1 year, up to a maximum of 3 years, whichever period is shorter, and shall make these records available for inspection and copy by authorized employees of the Food and Drug Administration. Such records shall include the food treated, lot identification, scheduled process, evidence of compliance with the scheduled process, ionizing energy source, source calibration, dosimetry, dose distribution in the product, and the date of irradiation.

An interim food additive regulation for the use of any such substance may be promulgated in this subpart when new information raises a substantial question about the safety or functionality of the substance but there is a reasonable certainty that the substance is not harmful and that no harm to the public health will result from the continued use of the substance for a limited period of time while the question raised is being resolved by further study.
</P>
<P>(b) No interim food additive regulation may be promulgated if the new information is conclusive with respect to the question raised or if there is a reasonable likelihood that the substance is harmful or that continued use of the substance will result in harm to the public health.
</P>
<P>(c) The Commissioner, on his own initiative or on the petition of any interested person, pursuant to part 10 of this chapter, may propose an interim food additive regulation. A final order promulgating an interim food additive regulation shall provide that continued use of the substance in food is subject to each of the following conditions:
</P>
<P>(1) Use of the substance in food or food contact surfaces must comply with whatever limitations the Commissioner deems to be appropriate under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>(2) Within 60 days following the effective date of the regulation, an interested person shall satisfy the Commissioner in writing that studies adequate and appropriate to resolve the questions raised about the substance have been undertaken, or the Food and Drug Administration may undertake the studies. The Commissioner may extend this 60-day period if necessary to review and act on proposed protocols. If no such commitment is made, or adequate and appropriate studies are not undertaken, an order shall immediately be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> revoking the interim food additive regulation effective upon publication.
</P>
<P>(3) A progress report shall be filed on the studies every January 1 and July 1 until completion. If the progress report is inadequate or if the Commissioner concludes that the studies are not being pursued promptly and diligently or if interim results indicate a reasonable likelihood that a health hazard exists, an order will promptly be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> revoking the interim food additive regulation effective upon publication.
</P>
<P>(4) If nonclinical laboratory studies are involved, studies filed with the Commissioner shall include, with respect to each study, either a statement that the study has been or will be conducted in compliance with the good laboratory practice regulations as set forth in part 58 of this chapter, or, if any such study was not conducted in compliance with such regulations, a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.
</P>
<P>(5) [Reserved]
</P>
<P>(6) If clinical investigations involving human subjects are involved, such investigations filed with the Commissioner shall include, with respect to each investigation, a statement that the investigation either was conducted in compliance with the requirements for institutional review set forth in part 56 of this chapter, or was not subject to such requirements in accordance with §§ 56.104 or 56.105, and that it has been or will be conducted in compliance with the requirements for informed consent set forth in part 50 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(d) Promptly upon completion of the studies undertaken on the substance, the Commissioner will review all available data, will terminate the interim food additive regulation, and will either issue a food additive regulation or will require elimination of the substance from the food supply.
</P>
<P>(e) The Commissioner may consult with advisory committees, professional organizations, or other experts in the field, in evaluating:
</P>
<P>(1) Whether an interim food additive regulation is justified,
</P>
<P>(2) The type of studies necessary and appropriate to resolve questions raised about a substance,
</P>
<P>(3) Whether interim results indicate the reasonable likelihood that a health hazard exists, or
</P>
<P>(4) Whether the data available at the conclusion of those studies justify a food additive regulation.
</P>
<P>(f) Where appropriate, an emergency action level may be issued for a substance subject to paragraph (a) of this section that is not an approved food additive, pending the issuance of a final interim food additive regulation. Such an action level shall be issued pursuant to sections 306 and 402(a) of the act to identify, based upon available data, a safe level of use for the substance. Such an action level shall be issued in a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and shall be followed as soon as practicable by a proposed interim food additive regulation. Where the available data do not permit establishing an action level for the safe use of a substance, use of the substance may be prohibited. The identification of a prohibited substance may be made in part 189 of this chapter when appropriate.

<P>(a) <I>Minimal erythema dose (MED).</I> The quantity of erythema-effective energy (expressed as Joules per square meter) required to produce the first perceptible, redness reaction with clearly defined borders.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Product category designation (PCD).</I> A labeling designation for sunscreen drug products to aid in selecting the type of product best suited to an individual's complexion (pigmentation) and desired response to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Minimal sun protection product.</I> A sunscreen product that provides a sun protection factor (SPF) value of 2 to under 12.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Moderate sun protection product.</I> A sunscreen product that provides an SPF value of 12 to under 30.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>High sun protection product.</I> A sunscreen product that provides an SPF value of 30 or above.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Sunscreen active ingredient.</I> An active ingredient listed in § 352.10 that absorbs, reflects, or scatters radiation in the UV range at wavelengths from 290 to 400 nanometers.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Sun protection factor (SPF) value.</I> The UV energy required to produce an MED on protected skin divided by the UV energy required to produce an MED on unprotected skin, which may also be defined by the following ratio: SPF value  = MED (protected skin (PS))/MED (unprotected skin (US)), where MED (PS) is the minimal erythema dose for protected skin after application of 2 milligrams per square centimeter of the final formulation of the sunscreen product, and MED (US) is the minimal erythema dose for unprotected skin, <I>i.e.</I>, skin to which no sunscreen product has been applied. In effect, the SPF value is the reciprocal of the effective transmission of the product viewed as a UV radiation filter.

<P>(2) Preparation A and preparation B are heated separately to 77 to 82 °C, with constant stirring, until the contents of each part are solubilized. Add preparation A slowly to preparation B while stirring. Continue stirring until the emulsion formed is cooled to room temperature (15 to 30 °C). Add sufficient purified water to obtain 100 grams of standard sunscreen preparation.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Assay of the standard homosalate sunscreen.</I> Assay the standard homosalate sunscreen preparation by the following method to ensure proper concentration:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Preparation of the assay solvent.</I> The solvent consists of 1 percent glacial acetic acid (V/V) in denatured ethanol. The denatured ethanol should not contain a UV radiation absorbing denaturant.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Preparation of a 1-percent solution of the standard homosalate sunscreen preparation.</I> Accurately weigh 1 gram of the standard homosalate sunscreen preparation into a 100-milliliter volumetric flask. Add 50 milliliters of the assay solvent. Heat on a steam bath and mix well. Cool the solution to room temperature (15 to 30 °C). Then dilute the solution to volume with the assay solvent and mix well to make a 1-percent solution.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Preparation of the test solution (1:50 dilution of the 1-percent solution).</I> Filter a portion of the 1-percent solution through number 1 filter paper. Discard the first 10 to 15 milliliters of the filtrate. Collect the next 20 milliliters of the filtrate (second collection). Add 1 milliliter of the second collection of the filtrate to a 50-milliliter volumetric flask. Dilute this solution to volume with assay solvent and mix well. This is the test solution (1:50 dilution of the 1-percent solution).
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Spectrophotometric determination.</I> The absorbance of the test solution is measured in a suitable double beam spectrophotometer with the assay solvent and reference beam at a wavelength near 306 nanometers.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Calculation of the concentration of homosalate.</I> The concentration of homosalate is determined by the following formula which takes into consideration the absorbance of the sample of the test solution, the dilution of the 1-percent solution (1:50), the weight of the sample of the standard homosalate sunscreen preparation (1 gram), and the standard absorbance value (172) of homosalate as determined by averaging the absorbance of a large number of batches of raw homosalate:
</P>
<FP-2>Concentration of homosalate = absorbance × 50 × 100 × 172 = percent concentration by weight.

<HEAD>§ 352.71   Light source (solar simulator).</HEAD>
<P>A solar simulator used for determining the SPF of a sunscreen drug product should be filtered so that it provides a continuous emission spectrum from 290 to 400 nanometers similar to sunlight at sea level from the sun at a zenith angle of 10° it has less than 1 percent of its total energy output contributed by nonsolar wavelengths shorter than 290 nanometers; and it has not more than 5 percent of its total energy output contributed by wavelengths longer than 400 nanometers. In addition, a solar simulator should have no significant time-related fluctuations in radiation emissions after an appropriate warmup time, and it should have good beam uniformity (within 10 percent) in the exposure plane. To ensure that the solar simulator delivers the appropriate spectrum of UV radiation, it must be measured periodically with an accurately-calibrated spectroradiometer system or equivalent instrument.

<HEAD>§ 352.72   General testing procedures.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Selection of test subjects (male and female).</I> (1) Only fair-skin subjects with skin types I, II, and III using the following guidelines shall be selected:

</FP-1>
<FP-1>V—Rarely burns; tans profusely (dark brown) (insensitive).
</FP-1>
<FP-1>VI—Never burns; deeply pigmented (insensitive).</FP-1></EXTRACT>
<P>(2) A medical history shall be obtained from all subjects with emphasis on the effects of sunlight on their skin. Ascertain the general health of the individual, the individual's skin type (I, II, or III), whether the individual is taking medication (topical or systemic) that is known to produce abnormal sunlight responses, and whether the individual is subject to any abnormal responses to sunlight, such as a phototoxic or photoallergic response.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Test site inspection.</I> The physical examination shall determine the presence of sunburn, suntan, scars, active dermal lesions, and uneven skin tones on the areas of the back to be tested. The presence of nevi, blemishes, or moles will be acceptable if in the physician's judgment they will not interfere with the study results. Excess hair on the back is acceptable if the hair is clipped or shaved.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Informed consent.</I> Legally effective written informed consent must be obtained from all individuals.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Test site delineation</I>—(1) <I>Test site area.</I> A test site area serves as an area for determining the subject's MED after application of either the sunscreen standard or the test sunscreen product, or for determining the subject's MED when the skin is unprotected (control site). The area to be tested shall be the back between the beltline and the shoulder blade (scapulae) and lateral to the midline. Each test site area for applying a product or the standard sunscreen shall be a minimum of 50-square centimeters, e.g., 5 × 10 centimeters. The test site areas are outlined with ink. If the person is to be tested in an upright position, the lines shall be drawn on the skin with the subject upright. If the subject is to be tested while prone, the markings shall be made with the subject prone.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Test subsite area.</I> Each test site area shall be divided into at least three test subsite areas that are at least 1 square centimeter. Usually four or five subsites are employed. Each test subsite within a test site area is subjected to a specified dosage of UV radiation, in a series of UV radiation exposures, in which the test site area is exposed for the determination of the MED.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Application of test materials.</I> To ensure standardized reporting and to define a product's SPF value, the application of the product shall be expressed on a weight basis per unit area which establishes a standard film. Both the test sunscreen product and the standard sunscreen application shall be 2 milligrams per square centimeter. For oils and most lotions, the viscosity is such that the material can be applied with a volumetric syringe. For creams, heavy gels, and butters, the product shall be warmed slightly so that it can be applied volumetrically. On heating, care shall be taken not to alter the product's physical characteristics, especially separation of the formulations. Pastes and ointments shall be weighed, then applied by spreading on the test site area. A product shall be spread by using a finger cot. If two or more sunscreen drug products are being evaluated at the same time, the test products and the standard sunscreen, as specified in § 352.70, should be applied in a blinded, randomized manner. If only one sunscreen drug product is being tested, the testing subsites should be exposed to the varying doses of UV radiation in a randomized manner.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Waiting period.</I> Before exposing the test site areas after applying a product, a waiting period of at least 15 minutes is required.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Number of subjects.</I> A test panel shall consist of not more than 25 subjects with the number fixed in advance by the investigator. From this panel, at least 20 subjects must produce valid data for analysis.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Response criteria.</I> In order that the person who evaluates the MED responses does not know which sunscreen formulation was applied to which site or what doses of UV radiation were administered, he/she must not be the same person who applied the sunscreen drug product to the test site or administered the doses of UV radiation. After UV radiation exposure from the solar simulator is completed, all immediate responses shall be recorded. These include several types of typical responses such as the following: An immediate darkening or tanning, typically greyish or purplish in color, fading in 30 to 60 minutes, and attributed to photo-oxidation of existing melanin granules; immediate reddening, fading rapidly, and viewed as a normal response of capillaries and venules to heat, visible and infrared radiation; and an immediate generalized heat response, resembling prickly heat rash, fading in 30 to 60 minutes, and apparently caused by heat and moisture generally irritating to the skin's surface. After the immediate responses are noted, each subject shall shield the exposed area from further UV radiation for the remainder of the test day. The MED is determined 22 to 24 hours after exposure. The erythema responses of the test subject should be evaluated under the following conditions: The source of illumination should be either a tungsten light bulb or a warm white fluorescent light bulb that provides a level of illumination at the test site within the range of 450 to 550 lux, and the test subject should be in the same position used when the test site was irradiated. Testing depends upon determining the smallest dose of energy that produces redness reaching the borders of the exposure site at 22 to 24 hours postexposure for each series of exposures. To determine the MED, somewhat more intense erythemas must also be produced. The goal is to have some exposures that produce absolutely no effect, and of those exposures that produce an effect, the maximal exposure should be no more than twice the total energy of the minimal exposure.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Rejection of test data.</I> Test data shall be rejected if the exposure series fails to elicit an MED response on either the treated or unprotected skin sites, or if the responses on the treated sites are randomly absent (which indicates the product was not spread evenly), or if the subject was noncompliant (e.g., subject withdraws from the test due to illness or work conflicts, subject does not shield the exposed testing sites from further UV radiation until the MED is read, etc.).

<HEAD>§ 352.73   Determination of SPF value.</HEAD>
<P>(a)(1) The following erythema action spectrum shall be used to calculate the erythema effective exposure of a solar simulator:
</P>
<FP-1>V<E T="52">i</E> (λ) = 1.0 (250 &lt;λ &lt;298 nm)

</FP-1>
<P>(2) The data contained in this action spectrum are to be used as spectral weighting factors to calculate the erythema effective exposure of a solar simulator as follows:
</P>
<img src="/graphics/er21my99.000.gif"/>
<P>(b) <I>Determination of MED of the unprotected skin.</I> A series of UV radiation exposures expressed as Joules per square meter (adjusted to the erythema action spectrum calculated according to § 352.73(a)) is administered to the subsite areas on each subject with an accurately calibrated solar simulator. A series of five exposures shall be administered to the untreated, unprotected skin to determine the subject's inherent MED. The doses selected shall be a geometric series represented by (1.25
<SU>n</SU>), wherein each exposure time interval is 25 percent greater than the previous time to maintain the same relative uncertainty (expressed as a constant percentage), independent of the subject's sensitivity to UV radiation, regardless of whether the subject has a high or low MED. Usually, the MED of a person's unprotected skin is determined the day prior to testing a product. This MED(US) shall be used in the determination of the series of UV radiation exposures to be administered to the protected site in subsequent testing. The MED(US) should be determined again on the same day as the standard and test sunscreens and this MED(US) should be used in calculating the SPF.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Determination of individual SPF values.</I> A series of UV radiation exposures expressed as Joules per square meter (adjusted to the erythema action spectrum calculated according to § 352.73(a)) is administered to the subsite areas on each subject with an accurately-calibrated solar simulator. A series of seven exposures shall be administered to the protected test sites to determine the MED of the protected skin (MED(PS)). The doses selected shall consist of a geometric series of five exposures, where the middle exposure is placed to yield the expected SPF plus two other exposures placed symmetrically around the middle exposure. The exact series of exposures to be given to the protected skin shall be determined by the previously established MED(US) and the expected SPF of the test sunscreen. For products with an expected SPF less than 8, the exposures shall be the MED(US) times 0.64X, 0.80X, 0.90X, 1.00X, 1.10X, 1.25X, and 1.56X, where X equals the expected SPF of the test product. For products with an expected SPF between 8 and 15, the exposures shall be the MED(US) times 0.69X, 0.83X, 0.91X, 1.00X, 1.09X, 1.20X, and 1.44X, where X equals the expected SPF of the test product. For products with an expected SPF greater that 15, the exposures shall be the MED(US) times 0.76X, 0.87X, 0.93X, 1.00X, 1.07X, 1.15X, and 1.32X, where X equals the expected SPF of the test product. The MED is the quantity of erythema-effective energy required to produce the first perceptible, unambiguous redness reaction with clearly defined borders at 22 to 24 hours postexposure. The SPF value of the test sunscreen is then calculated from the dose of UV radiation required to produce the MED of the protected skin and from the dose of UV radiation required to produce the MED of the unprotected skin (control site) as follows:
</P>
<P>SPF value  = the ratio of erythema effective exposure (Joules per square meter) (MED(PS)) to the erythema effective exposure (Joules per square meter) (MED(US)).
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Determination of the test product's SPF value and PCD.</I> Use data from at least 20 test subjects with n representing the number of subjects used. First, for each subject, compute the SPF value as stated in § 352.73(b) and (c). Second, compute the mean SPF value, x
<AC T="8"/>, and the standard deviation, s, for these subjects. Third, obtain the upper 5-percent point from the t distribution table with n-1 degrees of freedom. Denote this value by t. Fourth, compute ts/ √n. Denote this quantity by A (<I>i.e.</I>, A  = ts/ √n). Fifth, calculate the SPF value to be used in labeling as follows: the label SPF equals the largest whole number less than x
<AC T="8"/>. - A. Sixth and last, the drug product is classified into a PCD as follows: if 30 + A &lt;x
<AC T="8"/>, the PCD is High; if 12 + A &lt;x
<AC T="8"/> &lt;30 + A, the PCD is Moderate; if 2 + A &lt;x
<AC T="8"/> &lt;12 + A, the PCD is Minimal; if x
<AC T="8"/> &lt;2 + A, the product shall not be labeled as a sunscreen drug product and shall not display an SPF value.

<HEAD>§ 361.1   Radioactive drugs for certain research uses.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Radioactive drugs (as defined in § 310.3(n) of this chapter) are generally recognized as safe and effective when administered, under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, to human research subjects during the course of a research project intended to obtain basic information regarding the metabolism (including kinetics, distribution, and localization) of a radioactively labeled drug or regarding human physiology, pathophysiology, or biochemistry, but not intended for immediate therapeutic, diagnostic, or similar purposes or to determine the safety and effectiveness of the drug in humans for such purposes (<I>i.e.</I>, to carry out a clinical trial). Certain basic research studies, e.g., studies to determine whether a drug localizes in a particular organ or fluid space and to describe the kinetics of that localization, may have eventual therapeutic or diagnostic implications, but the initial studies are considered to be basic research within the meaning of this section. 
</P>
<P>(b) The conditions under which use of radioactive drugs for research are considered safe and effective are: 
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Approval by Radioactive Drug Research Committee.</I> A Radioactive Drug Research Committee, composed and approved by the Food and Drug Administration in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, has determined, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, that: 
</P>
<P>(i) The pharmacological dose is within the limits set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; 
</P>
<P>(ii) The radiation dose is within the limits set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; 
</P>
<P>(iii) The radiation exposure is justified by the quality of the study being undertaken and the importance of the information it seeks to obtain; 
</P>
<P>(iv) The study meets the other requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section regarding qualifications of the investigator, proper licensure for handling radioactive materials, selection and consent of research subjects, quality of radioactive drugs used, research protocol design, reporting of adverse reactions, and approval by an appropriate Institutional Review Committee; and 
</P>
<P>(v) The use of the radioactive drug in human subjects has the approval of the Radioactive Drug Research Committee. 
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Limit on pharmacological dose.</I> The amount of active ingredient or combination of active ingredients to be administered shall be known not to cause any clinically detectable pharmacological effect in human beings. If the same active ingredients (exclusive of the radionuclide) are to be administered simultaneously, e.g., under a “Investigational New Drug Application” or for a therapeutic use in accordance with labeling for a drug approved under part 314 of this chapter, the total amount of active ingredients including the radionuclide shall be known not to exceed the dose limitations applicable to the separate administration of the active ingredients excluding the radionuclide. 
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Limit on radiation dose.</I> The amount of radioactive material to be administered shall be such that the subject receives the smallest radiation dose with which it is practical to perform the study without jeopardizing the benefits to be obtained from the study. 
</P>
<P>(i) Under no circumstances may the radiation dose to an adult research subject from a single study or cumulatively from a number of studies conducted within 1 year be generally recognized as safe if such dose exceeds the following:

<P>(ii) For a research subject under 18 years of age at his last birthday, the radiation dose shall not exceed 10 percent of that set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. 
</P>
<P>(iii) All radioactive material included in the drug either as essential material or as a significant contaminant or impurity shall be included when determining the total radiation doses and dose commitments. Radiation doses from x-ray procedures that are part of the research study (<I>i.e.</I>, would not have occurred but for the study) shall also be included. The possibility of followup studies shall be considered for inclusion in the dose calculations. 
</P>
<P>(iv) Numerical definitions of dose shall be based on an absorbed fraction method of radiation absorbed dose calculation, such as the system set forth by the Medical Internal Radiation Dose Committee of the Society of Nuclear Medicine, or the system set forth by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. 
</P>
<P>(c) A Radioactive Drug Research Committee, in order to comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall be composed, shall function, and shall obtain and maintain approval of the Food and Drug Administration in conformity with the following: 
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Membership.</I> A Radioactive Drug Research Committee shall consist of at least five individuals. Each committee shall include the following three individuals: (i) A physician recognized as a specialist in nuclear medicine, (ii) a person qualified by training and experience to formulate radioactive drugs, and (iii) a person with special competence in radiation safety and radiation dosimetry. The remainder of the committee shall consist of individuals qualified in various disciplines pertinent to the field of nuclear medicine (e.g., radiology, internal medicine, clinical pathology, hematology, endocrinology, radiation therapy, radiation physics, radiation biophysics, health physics, and radiopharmacy). Membership shall be sufficiently diverse to permit expert review of the technical and scientific aspects of proposals submitted to the committee. The addition of consultants in other pertinent medical disciplines is encouraged. A Radioactive Drug Research Committee shall be either associated with a medical institution operated for care of patients and with sufficient scientific expertise to allow for selection of committee members from its faculty, or with a committee established by a State authority to provide advice on radiation health matters. Joint committees involving more than one medical institution which have been established in order to achieve a high level and diversity of experience will be acceptable. The Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research may modify any of the foregoing requirements in a particular situation where alternative factors provide substantially the same composition and association. 
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Function.</I> Each Radioactive Drug Research Committee shall select a chairman, who shall sign all applications, minutes, and reports of the committee. Each committee shall meet at least once each quarter in which research activity has been authorized or conducted. A quorum consisting of more than 50 percent of the membership must be present with appropriate representation of the required fields of specialization. Minutes shall be kept and shall include the numerical results of votes on protocols involving use in human subjects. No member shall vote on a protocol in which he is an investigator. 
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Reports.</I> Each Radioactive Drug Research Committee shall submit an annual report on or before January 31 of each year to the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, HFD-160, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. The annual report shall include the names and qualifications of the members of, and of any consultants used by, the Radioactive Drug Research Committee, and, for each study conducted during the preceding year, a summary of information presented in the following format:

<FP>At any time a proposal is approved which involves exposure either of more than 30 research subjects, or of any research subject under 18 years of age, the committee shall immediately submit to the Food and Drug Administration a special summary of information in the format shown in this paragraph. Contents of these reports are available for public disclosure, unless confidentiality is requested by the investigator and it is adequately shown by the investigator that the report constitutes a trade secret or confidential commercial information as defined in § 20.61 of this chapter. 
</FP>
<P>(4) <I>Approval.</I> Each Radioactive Drug Research Committee shall be specifically approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research of the Food and Drug Administration. Applications shall be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, HFD-160, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, and shall contain the names and qualifications of the members of the committee, and a statement that the committee agrees to comply with the requirements set forth in this section. Approval shall be based upon an assessment of the qualifications of the members of the committee, and the assurance that all necessary fields of expertise are covered. Approval of a committee may be withdrawn at any time for failure of the committee to comply with any of the requirements of this section. Approval of a committee shall remain effective unless and until the FDA withdraws such approval. Changes in membership and applications for new members shall be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration as soon as, or before, vacancies occur on the committee. 
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Monitoring.</I> The Food and Drug Administration shall conduct periodic reviews of approved committees. Monitoring of the activities of the committee shall be conducted through review of its annual report, through review of minutes and full protocols for certain studies, and through on-site inspections. 
</P>
<P>(d) In making the determination required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a Radioactive Drug Research Committee shall consider the following requirements and assure that each is met: 
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Radiation dose to subjects.</I> To assure that the radiation dose to research subjects is as low as practicable to perform the study and meet the criteria of § 361.1(b)(3), the Radioactive Drug Research Committee shall require that: 
</P>
<P>(i) The investigator provide absorbed dose calculations based on biologic distribution data available from published literature or from other valid studies. 
</P>
<P>(ii) The investigator provide for an acceptable method of radioassay of the radioactive drug prior to its use to assure that the dose calculations actually reflect the administered dose. 
</P>
<P>(iii) The radioactive drug chosen for the study has that combination of half-life, types of radiations, radiation energy, metabolism, chemical properties, etc., which results in the lowest dose to the whole body or specific organs with which it is possible to obtain the necessary information. 
</P>
<P>(iv) The investigator utilize adequate and appropriate instrumentation for the detection and measurement of the specific radionuclide. 
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Pharmacological dosage.</I> To determine that the amount of active ingredients to be administered does not exceed the limitations set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the committee shall require that the investigator provide pharmacological dose calculations based on data available from published literature or from other valid human studies. 
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Qualifications of investigators.</I> Each investigator shall be qualified by training and experience to conduct the proposed research studies. 
</P>
<P>(4) <I>License to handle radioactive materials.</I> The responsible investigator or institutions shall, in the case of reactor-produced isotopes, be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or Agreement State to possess and use the specific radionuclides for research use or be a listed investigator under a broad license, or in the case of non-reactor-produced isotopes, be licensed by other appropriate State or local authorities, when required by State or local law, to possess and use the specific radionuclides for research use. 
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Human research subjects.</I> Each investigator shall select appropriate human subjects and shall obtain the review and approval of an institutional review committee that conforms to the requirements of part 56 of this chapter, and shall obtain the consent of the subjects or their legal representatives in accordance with part 50 of this chapter. The research subjects shall be at least 18 years of age and legally competent. Exceptions are permitted only in those special situations when it can be demonstrated to the committee that the study presents a unique opportunity to gain information not currently available, requires the use of research subjects less than 18 years of age, and is without significant risk to the subject. Studies involving minors shall be supported with review by qualified pediatric consultants to the Radioactive Drug Research Committee. Each female research subject of childbearing potential shall state in writing that she is not pregnant, or, on the basis of a pregnancy test be confirmed as not pregnant, before she may participate in any study.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Quality of radioactive drug.</I> The radioactive drug used in the research study shall meet appropriate chemical, pharmaceutical, radiochemical, and radionuclidic standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity as needed for safety and be of such uniform and reproducible quality as to give significance to the research study conducted. The Radioactive Drug Research Committee shall determine that radioactive materials for parenteral use are prepared in sterile and pyrogen-free form. 
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Research protocol.</I> No matter how small the amount of radioactivity, no study involving administration of a radioactive drug, as defined in § 310.3(n) of this chapter, to research subjects under this section, shall be permitted unless the Radioactive Drug Research Committee concludes, in its judgment, that scientific knowledge and benefit is likely to result from that study. Therefore, the protocol shall be based upon a sound rationale derived from appropriate animal studies or published literature and shall be of sound design such that information of scientific value may result. The radiation dose shall be both sufficient and no greater than necessary to obtain valid measurement. The projected number of subjects shall be sufficient but no greater than necessary for the purpose of the study. The number of subjects shall also reflect the fact that the study is intended to obtain basic research information referred to in paragraph (a) of this section and not intended for immediate therapeutic, diagnostic or similar purposes or to determine the safety and effectiveness of the drug in humans for such purposes (<I>i.e.</I>, to carry out a clinical trial). 
</P>
<P>(8) <I>Adverse reactions.</I> The investigator shall immediately report to the Radioactive Drug Research Committee all adverse effects associated with the use of the radioactive drug in the research study. All adverse reactions probably attributable to the use of the radioactive drug in the research study shall be immediately reported by the Radioactive Drug Research Committee to the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, HFD-160, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. 
</P>
<P>(9) <I>Approval by an institutional review board.</I> The investigator shall obtain the review and approval of an institutional review board that conforms to the requirements of part 56 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(e) The results of any research conducted pursuant to this section as part of the evaluation of a drug pursuant to part 312 of this chapter shall be included in the submissions required under part 312 of this chapter. 
</P>
<P>(f) A radioactive drug prepared, packaged, distributed, and primarily intended for use in accordance with the requirements of this section shall be exempt from section 502(f)(1) of the act and §§ 201.5 and 201.100 of this chapter if the packaging, label, and labeling are in compliance with Federal, State, and local law regarding radioactive materials and if the label of the immediate container and shielded container, if any, either separate from or as part of any label and labeling required for radioactive materials by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or by State or local radiological health authorities bear the following: 
</P>
<P>(1) The statement “Rx only”; 
</P>
<P>(2) The statement “To be administered in compliance with the requirements of Federal regulations regarding radioactive drugs for research use (21 CFR 361.1)”; 
</P>
<P>(3) The established name of the drug, if any; 
</P>
<P>(4) The established name and quantity of each active ingredient;

<HEAD>§ 500.27   Methylene blue-containing drugs for use in animals.</HEAD>
<P>(a) New information requires a re- evaluation of the status of drugs containing methylene blue (tetramethylthionine chloride) for oral use in cats or dogs.
</P>
<P>(1)(i) It has been demonstrated that two orally administered urinary antiseptic-antispasmodic preparations that contained methylene blue cause Heinz body hemolytic anemia in cats when used according to label directions. The specific cause of the reaction was determined to be the methylene blue contained in the preparations. The reaction can be severe enough to cause death of treated animals.
</P>
<P>(ii) The Heinz body hemolytic anemia reaction to methylene blue has also been demonstrated in dogs under laboratory conditions. The precise mechanism by which methylene blue produces the characteristic erythrocytic inclusion bodies (Heinz bodies) and associated hemolytic anemia is unclear.
</P>
<P>(2) The effectiveness of orally administered methylene blue as a urinary antiseptic is open to question. It appears that following oral administration, methylene blue is poorly and erratically absorbed and also slowly and erratically excreted in the urine. Studies in the dog indicate it is excreted in the urine essentially as leukomethylene blue stabilized in some manner. Methylene blue itself is stepwise demethylated in alkaline solutions (alkaline urine being a frequent consequence of urinary infection) to Azure B, Azure A, and Azure C. The antiseptic efficacy of all of these excretion products is unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>(3) In view of the foregoing, the Commissioner has concluded that animal drugs containing methylene blue for oral use in cats or dogs are neither safe nor generally recognized as effective within the meaning of section 201(v) of the act and are therefore considered new animal drugs. Accordingly, all prior formal and informal opinions expressed by the Food and Drug Administration that such drugs are “not new drugs” or “no longer new drugs” are hereby revoked.
</P>
<P>(b) Animal drugs that contain methylene blue for oral use in cats or dogs and not the subject of an approved new animal drug application (NADA) are deemed to be adulterated under the provisions of section 501(a) (5) and/or (6) and/or misbranded under section 502(a) of the act and subject to regulatory action as of April 10, 1978.

Submission of an NADA will not constitute grounds for continued marketing of this drug substance until such application is approved.

<HEAD>§ 500.45   Use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) in the production, handling, and storage of animal feed.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) represent a class of toxic industrial chemicals manufactured and sold under a variety of trade names, including: Aroclor (United States); Phenoclor (France); Colphen (Germany); and Kanaclor (Japan). PCB's are highly stable, heat resistant, and nonflammable chemicals. Industrial uses of PCB's include, or did include in the past, their use as electrical transformer and capacitor fluids, heat transfer fluids, hydraulic fluids, plasticizers, and in formulations of lubricants, coatings, and inks. Their unique physical and chemical properties and widespread, uncontrolled industrial applications have caused PCB's to be a persistent and ubiquitous contaminant in the environment, causing the contamination of certain foods. In addition, incidents have occurred in which PCB's have directly contaminated animal feeds as a result of industrial accidents (leakage or spillage of PCB fluids from plant equipment). These accidents in turn cause the contamination of food intended for human consumption (meat, milk, and eggs). Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration have revealed that heat exchange fluids for certain pasteurization equipment used in processing animal feed contain PCB's. Although heat exchange fluids in such equipment are considered to be in <I>closed systems,</I> leakage has occurred that resulted in direct contamination of animal feed with PCB's and subsequently resulted in the transfer of PCB's to human food produced by animals consuming the contaminated feed. The use of PCB-containing coatings on the inner walls of silos has resulted in the contamination of silage which has in turn caused PCB residues in the milk of dairy cows consuming the contaminated silage. Since PCB's are toxic chemicals, the PCB contamination of food as a result of these and other incidents represent a hazard to public health. It is therefore necessary to place certain restrictions on the industrial uses of PCB's in the production, handling, and storage of animal feed. 
</P>
<P>(b) The following special provisions are necessary to preclude accidental PCB contamination of animal feed: 
</P>
<P>(1) Coatings or paints for use on the contact surfaces of feed storage areas may not contain PCB's or any other harmful or deleterious substances likely to contaminate feed. 
</P>
<P>(2) New equipment or machinery for handling or processing feed in or around an establishment producing animal feed shall not contain PCB's. 
</P>
<P>(3) On or before Sept. 4, 1973, the management of establishments producing animal feed shall: 
</P>
<P>(i) Have the heat exchange fluid used in existing equipment or machinery for handling and processing feed sampled and tested to determine whether it contains PCB's, or verify the absence of PCB's in such formulations by other appropriate means. On or before Sept. 4, 1973, any such fluid formulated with PCB's must to the fullest extent possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices, be replaced with a heat exchange fluid that does not contain PCB's. 
</P>
<P>(ii) Eliminate to the fullest extent possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices from the animal feed producing establishment any PCB-containing lubricants for equipment or machinery used for handling or processing animal feed. 
</P>
<P>(iii) Eliminate to the fullest extent possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices from the animal feed producing establishment any other PCB-containing materials, whenever there is a reasonable expectation that such materials could cause animal feed to become contaminated with PCB's either as a result of normal use or as a result of accident, breakage, or other mishap. 
</P>

<P>(a) Anaphylactoid reactions in cattle, horses, sheep, and swine occur occasionally from the injection of antibiotics, bacterins, and vaccines. Adequate directions for use of these antibiotics, bacterins, and vaccines can generally be written for use by the laity and thus are available to livestock producers. Epinephrine injection is effective for the treatment of anaphylactoid reactions in animals and would be of value in saving lives of animals if it were readily available at the time of administration of the causative agents. In connection with this problem the Food and Drug Administration has obtained the views of the Advisory Committee on Veterinary Medicine, and other experts, and has concluded that adequate directions for over-the-counter sale of epinephrine injection 1:1,000 can be prepared. 
</P>
<P>(b) In view of the above, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that it is in the public interest to make epinephrine injection 1:1,000 available for sale without a prescription provided that it is packaged in vials not exceeding 10 milliliters and its label bears, in addition to other required information, the following statements in a prominent and conspicuous manner: “For emergency use only in treating anaphylactoid shock. Usual Dosage: Cattle, horses, sheep, and swine—1 cubic centimeter per 100 pounds of body weight. Inject subcutaneously”.

<HEAD>§ 500.80   Scope of this subpart.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires that sponsored compounds intended for use in food-producing animals be shown to be safe and that food produced from animals exposed to these compounds be shown to be safe for consumption by people. The statute prohibits the use in food-producing animals of any compound found to induce cancer when ingested by people or animals unless it can be determined by methods of examination prescribed or approved by the Secretary (a function delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs) that no residue of that compound will be found in the food produced from those animals under conditions of use reasonably certain to be followed in practice. This subpart identifies the steps a sponsor of a compound shall follow to secure the approval of the compound. The requirements of this subpart shall also apply to a request for an import tolerance under § 510.205 of this chapter. FDA guidance documents contain the procedures and protocols FDA recommends for the implementation of this subpart. These guidance documents are available from the Dockets Management Staff (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. Requests for these guidance documents should be identified with Docket No. 1983D-0288.
</P>
<P>(b) If FDA concludes on the basis of the threshold assessment that a sponsor shall conduct carcinogenicity testing on the sponsored compound, FDA will also determine whether and to what extent the sponsor shall conduct carcinogenicity testing on metabolites of the sponsored compound. The bioassays that a sponsor conducts must be designed to assess carcinogenicity and to determine the quantitative aspects of any carcinogenic response. 
</P>
<P>(c) If FDA concludes on the basis of the threshold assessment or at a later time during the approval process or during the review of a request for an import tolerance that the data show that the sponsored compound and its metabolites should not be subject to this subpart, FDA will continue to consider the compound for approval under the general safety provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for risks other than cancer or continue its review of the import tolerance request under the provisions of §§ 510.201 through 510.213 of this chapter (Subpart C—Import Tolerances for Residues of Unapproved New Animal Drugs in Food).

<HEAD>§ 501.1   Principal display panel of package form animal food.</HEAD>
<P>The term <I>principal display panel</I> as it applies to food in package form and as used in this part, means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display panel shall be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label information required to be placed thereon by this part with clarity and conspicuousness and without obscuring design, vignettes, or crowding. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, information required to be placed on the principal display panel shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. For the purpose of obtaining uniform type size in declaring the quantity of contents for all packages of substantially the same size, the term <I>area of the principal display panel</I> means the area of the side or surface that bears the principal display panel, which area shall be: 
</P>
<P>(a) In the case of a rectangular package where one entire side properly can be considered to be the principal display panel side, the product of the height times the width of that side; 
</P>
<P>(b) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container, 40 percent of the product of the height of the container times the circumference; 
</P>
<P>(c) In the case of any otherwise shaped container, 40 percent of the total surface of the container: <I>Provided, however,</I> That where such container presents an obvious <I>principal display panel</I> such as the top of a triangular or circular package, the area shall consist of the entire top surface. In determining the area of the principal display panel, exclude tops, bottoms, flanges at tops and bottoms of cans, and shoulders and necks of bottles or jars. In the case of cylindrical or nearly cylindrical containers, information required by this part to appear on the principal display panel shall appear within that 40 percent of the circumference which is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale.

<HEAD>§ 501.2   Information panel of package for animal food.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The term <I>information panel</I> as it applies to packaged food means that part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel with the following exceptions: 
</P>
<P>(1) If the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel is too small to accommodate the necessary information or is otherwise unusable label space, e.g., folded flaps or can ends, the panel immediately contiguous and to the right of this part of the label may be used. 
</P>
<P>(2) If the package has one or more alternate principal display panels, the information panel is immediately contiguous and to the right of any principal display panel. 
</P>
<P>(3) If the top of the container is the principal display panel and the package has no alternate principal display panel, the information panel is any panel adjacent to the principal display panel. 
</P>
<P>(b) All information required to appear on the label of any package of food pursuant to §§ 501.4, 501.5, 501.8 and 501.17 shall appear either on the principal display panel or on the information panel, unless otherwise specified by regulations in this chapter. 
</P>
<P>(c) All information appearing on the principal display panel or the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear prominently and conspicuously, but in no case may the letters and/or numbers be less than 
<FR>1/16</FR> inch in height unless an exemption pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section is established. The requirements for conspicuousness and legibility shall include the specifications of §§ 501.15 and 501.105(h) (1) and (2). 
</P>
<P>(1) Packaged foods are exempt from the type size requirements of this paragraph: <I>Provided,</I> That: 
</P>
<P>(i) The package is designed such that it has a surface area that can bear an information panel and/or an alternate principal display panel. 
</P>
<P>(ii) The area of surface available for labeling on the principal display panel of the package as this term is defined in § 501.1 is less than 10 square inches.

<P>(i) The package is designed such that it has a single <I>obvious principal display panel</I> as this term is defined in § 501.1 and has no other available surface area for an information panel or alternate principal display panel. 
</P>
<P>(ii) The area of surface available for labeling on the principal display panel of the package as this term is defined in § 501.1 is less than 12 square inches and bears all labeling appearing on the package. 
</P>
<P>(iii) The label information includes a full list of ingredients in accordance with regulations in this part. 
</P>

<FR>1/32</FR> inch in height. 
</P>
<P>(3) Packaged foods are exempt from the type size requirements of this paragraph: <I>Provided,</I> That: 
</P>

<P>(d) All information required to appear on the principal display panel or on the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear on the same panel unless there is insufficient space. In determining the sufficiency of the available space, any vignettes, design, and other nonmandatory label information shall not be considered. If there is insufficient space for all of this information to appear on a single panel, it may be divided between these two panels except that the information required pursuant to any given section or part shall all appear on the same panel. A food whose label is required to bear the ingredient statement on the principal display panel may bear all other information specified in paragraph (b) of this section on the information panel. 
</P>
<P>(e) All information appearing on the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear in one place without other intervening material. 
</P>
<P>(f) If the label of any package of food is too small to accommodate all of the information required by §§ 501.4, 501.5, 501.8, and 501.17, the Commissioner may establish by regulation an acceptable alternative method of disseminating such information to the public, e.g., a type size smaller than one-sixteenth inch in height, or labeling attached to or inserted in the package or available at the point of purchase. A petition requesting such a regulation, as an amendment to this paragraph shall be submitted pursuant to part 10 of this chapter.

<HEAD>§ 501.3   Identity labeling of animal food in package form.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear as one of its principal features a statement of the identity of the commodity. 
</P>
<P>(b) Such statement of identity shall be in terms of: 
</P>
<P>(1) The name now or hereafter specified in or required by any applicable Federal law or regulation; or, in the absence thereof, 
</P>
<P>(2) The common or usual name of the food; or, in the absence thereof, 
</P>
<P>(3) An appropriately descriptive term, or when the nature of the food is obvious, a fanciful name commonly used by the public for such food. 
</P>
<P>(c) Where a food is marketed in various optional forms (whole, slices, diced, etc.), the particular form shall be considered to be a necessary part of the statement of identity and shall be declared in letters of a type size bearing a reasonable relation to the size of the letters forming the other components of the statement of identity; except that if the optional form is visible through the container or is depicted by an appropriate vignette, the particular form need not be included in the statement. This specification does not affect the required declarations of identity under definitions and standards for foods promulgated pursuant to section 401 of the act. 
</P>
<P>(d) This statement of identity shall be presented in bold type on the principal display panel, shall be in a size reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on such panel, and shall be in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed. 
</P>
<P>(e) Under the provisions of section 403(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if it is an imitation of another food unless its label bears, in type of uniform size and prominence, the word <I>imitation</I> and, immediately thereafter, the name of the food imitated. 
</P>
<P>(1) A food shall be deemed to be an imitation and thus subject to the requirements of section 403(c) of the act if it is a substitute for and resembles another food but is nutritionally inferior to that food. 
</P>
<P>(2) A food that is a substitute for and resembles another food shall not be deemed to be an imitation provided it meets each of the following requirements: 
</P>
<P>(i) It is not nutritionally inferior to the food for which it substitutes and which it resembles. 
</P>
<P>(ii) Its label bears a common or usual name that complies with the provisions of § 502.5 of this chapter and that is not false or misleading, or in the absence of an existing common or usual name, an appropriately descriptive term that is not false or misleading. The label may, in addition, bear a fanciful name which is not false or misleading. 
</P>
<P>(3) A food for which a common or usual name is established by regulation (e.g., in a standard of identity pursuant to section 401 of the act, in a common or usual name regulation and may, in addition, bear a fanciful name which is not false or misleading, and established pursuant to part 502 of this chapter), and which complies with all of the applicable requirements of such regulation(s), shall not be deemed to be an imitation.
</P>
<P>(4) Nutritional inferiority includes: 
</P>
<P>(i) Any reduction in the content of an essential nutrient that is present in a measurable amount. 
</P>
<P>(ii) If the Commissioner concludes that a food is a substitute for and resembles another food but is inferior to the food imitated for reasons other than those set forth in this paragraph, he may propose appropriate revisions to this regulation or he may propose a separate regulation governing the particular food. 
</P>
<P>(f) A label may be required to bear the percentage(s) of a characterizing ingredient(s) or information concerning the presence or absence of an ingredient(s) or the need to add an ingredient(s) as part of the common or usual name of the food pursuant to part 502 of this chapter.

<P>(2) A trademark or trade name provided that as applied to the article in question its use is not deceptively misdescriptive. A trademark or trade name comprised in whole or in part of geographical words shall not be considered deceptively misdescriptive if it: 
</P>
<P>(i) Has been so long and exclusively used by a manufacturer or distributor that it is generally understood by the consumer to mean the product of a particular manufacturer or distributor; or 
</P>
<P>(ii) Is so arbitrary or fanciful that it is not generally understood by the consumer to suggest geographic origin. 
</P>
<P>(3) A part of the name required by applicable Federal law or regulation. 
</P>
<P>(4) A name whose market significance is generally understood by the consumer to connote a particular class, kind, type, or style of food rather than to indicate geographical origin.

<HEAD>§ 501.22   Animal foods; labeling of spices, flavorings, colorings, and chemical preservatives.</HEAD>
<P>(a)(1) The term <I>artificial flavor</I> or <I>artificial flavoring</I> means any substance, the function of which is to impart flavor, which is not derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof. Artificial flavor includes the substances listed in §§ 172.515(b) and 582.60 of this chapter except where these are derived from natural sources. 
</P>
<P>(2) The term <I>spice</I> means any aromatic vegetable substance in the whole, broken, or ground form, except for those substances which have been traditionally regarded as foods, such as onions, garlic and celery; whose significant function in food is seasoning rather than nutritional; that is true to name; and from which no portion of any volatile oil or other flavoring principle has been removed. Spices include the spices listed in subpart A of part 582 of this chapter, such as the following:
</P>
<EXTRACT>
<FP-1>Allspice, Anise, Basil, Bay leaves, Caraway seed, Cardamon, Celery seed, Chervil, Cinnamon, Cloves, Coriander, Cumin seed, Dill seed, Fennel seed, Fenugreek, Ginger, Horseradish, Mace, Marjoram, Mustard flour, Nutmeg, Oregano, Paprika, Parsley, Pepper, black; Pepper, white; Pepper, red; Rosemary, Saffron, Sage, Savory, Star aniseed, Tarragon, Thyme, Turmeric.</FP-1></EXTRACT>

</FP>
<P>(3) The term <I>natural flavor</I> or <I>natural flavoring</I> means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors, include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in subpart A of part 582 of this chapter, and the substances listed in § 172.510 of this chapter. 
</P>
<P>(4) The term <I>artificial color</I> or <I>artificial coloring</I> means any <I>color additive</I> as defined in § 70.3(f) of this chapter. 
</P>
<P>(5) The term <I>chemical preservative</I> means any chemical that, when added to food, tends to prevent or retard deterioration thereof, but does not include common salt, sugars, vinegars, spices, or oils extracted from spices, substances added to food by direct exposure thereof to wood smoke, or chemicals applied for their insecticidal or herbicidal properties. 
</P>
<P>(b) A food which is subject to the requirements of section 403(k) of the act shall bear labeling, even though such food is not in package form. 
</P>
<P>(c) A statement of artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservative shall be placed on the food, or on its container or wrapper, or on any two or all of these, as may be necessary to render such statement likely to be read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use of such food. 
</P>
<P>(d) A food shall be exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 403(k) of the act if it is not in package form and the units thereof are so small that a statement of artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservative, as the case may be, cannot be placed on such units with such conspicuousness as to render it likely to be read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use. 
</P>
<P>(e) A food shall be exempt while held for sale from the requirements of section 403(k) of the act (requiring label statement of any artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservatives) if said food, having been received in bulk containers at a retail establishment, is displayed to the purchaser with either (1) the labeling of the bulk container plainly in view or (2) a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the information required to be stated on the label pursuant to section 403(k) of the act. 
</P>
<P>(f) A fruit or vegetable shall be exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 403(k) of the act with respect to a chemical preservative applied to the fruit or vegetable as a pesticide chemical prior to harvest. 
</P>
<P>(g) A flavor shall be labeled in the following way when shipped to a food manufacturer or processor (but not a consumer) for use in the manufacture of a fabricated food, unless it is a flavor for which a standard of identity has been promulgated, in which case it shall be labeled as provided in the standard: 
</P>
<P>(1) If the flavor consists of one ingredient, it shall be declared by its common or usual name. 
</P>
<P>(2) If the flavor consists of two or more ingredients, the label either may declare each ingredient by its common or usual name or may state “All flavor ingredients contained in this product are approved for use in a regulation of the Food and Drug Administration.” Any flavor ingredient not contained in one of these regulations, and any nonflavor ingredient, shall be separately listed on the label. 
</P>
<P>(3) In cases where the flavor contains a solely natural flavor(s), the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g., <I>strawberry flavor, banana flavor,</I> or <I>natural strawberry flavor.</I> In cases where the flavor contains both a natural flavor and an artificial flavor, the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g., <I>natural and artificial strawberry flavor.</I> In cases where the flavor contains a solely artificial flavor(s), the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g., <I>artificial strawberry flavor.</I> 
</P>
<P>(h) The label of a food to which flavor is added shall declare the flavor in the statement of ingredients in the following way: 
</P>
<P>(1) Spice, natural flavor, and artificial flavor may be declared as <I>spice, natural flavor,</I> or <I>artificial flavor,</I> or any combination thereof, as the case may be. 
</P>
<P>(2) An incidental additive in a food, originating in a spice or flavor used in the manufacture of the food, need not be declared in the statement of ingredients if it meets the requirements of § 501.100(a)(3). 
</P>
<P>(3) Substances obtained by cutting, grinding, drying, pulping, or similar processing of tissues derived from fruit, vegetable, meat, fish, or poultry, e.g., powdered or granulated onions, garlic powder, and celery powder, are commonly understood by consumers to be food rather than flavor and shall be declared by their common or usual name. 
</P>
<P>(4) Any salt (sodium chloride) used as an ingredient in food shall be declared by its common or usual name <I>salt.</I> 
</P>
<P>(5) Any monosodium glutamate used as an ingredient in food shall be declared by its common or usual name <I>monosodium glutamate.</I> 
</P>
<P>(6) Any pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavors used as an ingredient in a food may be declared as <I>artificial flavor</I> or <I>artificial smoke flavor.</I> No representation may be made, either directly or implied, that a food flavored with pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavor has been smoked or has a true smoked flavor, or that a seasoning sauce or similar product containing pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavor and used to season or flavor other foods will result in a smoked product or one having a true smoked flavor. 
</P>
<P>(i) If the label, labeling, or advertising of a food makes any direct or indirect representations with respect to the primary recognizable flavor(s), by word, <I>vignette,</I> e.g., depiction of a fruit, or other means, or if for any other reason the manufacturer or distributor of a food wishes to designate the type of flavor in the food other than through the statement of ingredients, such flavor shall be considered the characterizing flavor and shall be declared in the following way: 
</P>
<P>(1) If the food contains no artificial flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the name of the food on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be accompanied by the common or usual name of the characterizing flavor in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the food, except that: 
</P>
<P>(i) If the food is one that is commonly expected to contain a characterizing food ingredient, and the food contains natural flavor derived from such ingredient and an amount of characterizing ingredient insufficient to independently characterize the food, or the food contains no such ingredient, the name of the characterizing flavor may be immediately preceded by the word <I>natural</I> and shall be immediately followed by the word <I>flavored</I> in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of the characterizing flavor. 
</P>
<P>(ii) If none of the natural flavor used in the food is derived from the product whose flavor is simulated, the food in which the flavor is used shall be labeled either with the flavor of the product from which the flavor is derived or as <I>artificially flavored.</I> 
</P>
<P>(iii) If the food contains both a characterizing flavor from the product whose flavor is simulated and other natural flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the food shall be labeled in accordance with the introductory text and paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section and the name of the food shall be immediately followed by the words <I>with other natural flavor</I> in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the characterizing flavor. 
</P>
<P>(2) If the food contains any artificial flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the name of the food on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be accompanied by the common or usual name(s) of the characterizing flavor, in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the food and the name of the characterizing flavor shall be accompanied by the word(s) <I>artificial</I> or <I>artificially flavored,</I> in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of the characterizing flavor. 
</P>
<P>(3) Wherever the name of the characterizing flavor appears on the label (other than in the statement of ingredients) so conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions of purchase, the words prescribed by this paragraph shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow such name, without any intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, except: 
</P>
<P>(i) Where the characterizing flavor and a trademark or brand are presented together, other written, printed, or graphic matter that is a part of or is associated with the trademark or brand may intervene if the required words are in such relationship with the trademark or brand as to be clearly related to the characterizing flavor; and 
</P>
<P>(ii) If the finished product contains more than one flavor subject to the requirements of this paragraph, the statements required by this paragraph need appear only once in each statement of characterizing flavors present in such food. 
</P>
<P>(iii) If the finished product contains three or more distinguishable characterizing flavors, or a blend of flavors with no primary recognizable flavor, the flavor may be declared by an appropriately descriptive generic term in lieu of naming each flavor. 
</P>
<P>(4) A flavor supplier shall certify, in writing, that any flavor he supplies which is designated as containing no artificial flavor does not, to the best of his knowledge and belief, contain any artificial flavor, and that he has added no artificial flavor to it. The requirement for such certification may be satisfied by a guarantee under section 303(c)(2) of the act which contains such a specific statement. A flavor used shall be required to make such a written certification only where he adds to or combines another flavor with a flavor which has been certified by a flavor supplier as containing no artificial flavor, but otherwise such user may rely upon the supplier's certification and need make no separate certification. All such certifications shall be retained by the certifying party throughout the period in which the flavor is supplied and for a minimum of 3 years thereafter, and shall be subject to the following conditions: 
</P>
<P>(i) The certifying party shall make such certifications available upon request at all reasonable hours to any duly authorized officer, or employee of the Food and Drug Administration or any other employee acting on behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Such certifications are regarded by the Food and Drug Administration as reports to the government and as guarantees or other undertakings within the meaning of section 301(h) of the act and subject the certifying party to the penalties for making any false report to the government under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and any false guarantee or undertaking under section 303(a) of the act. The defenses provided under section 303(c)(2) of the act shall be applicable to the certifications provided for in this section. 
</P>
<P>(ii) Wherever possible, the Food and Drug Administration shall verify the accuracy of a reasonable number of certifications made pursuant to this section, constituting a representative sample of such certifications, and shall not request all such certifications. 
</P>
<P>(iii) Where no person authorized to provide such information is reasonably available at the time of inspection, the certifying party shall arrange to have such person and the relevant materials and records ready for verification as soon as practicable; provided that, whenever the Food and Drug Administration has reason to believe that the supplier or user may utilize this period to alter inventories or records, such additional time shall not be permitted. Where such additional time is provided, the Food and Drug Administration may require the certifying party to certify that relevant inventories have not been materially disturbed and relevant records have not been altered or concealed during such period. 
</P>
<P>(iv) The certifying party shall provide, to an officer or representative duly designated by the Secretary, such qualitative statement of the composition of the flavor or product covered by the certification as may be reasonably expected to enable the Secretary's representatives to determine which relevant raw and finished materials and flavor ingredient records are reasonably necessary to verify the certifications. The examination conducted by the Secretary's representative shall be limited to inspection and review of inventories and ingredient records for those certifications which are to be verified. 
</P>
<P>(v) Review of flavor ingredient records shall be limited to the qualitative formula and shall not include the quantitative formula. The person verifying the certifications may make only such notes as are necessary to enable him to verify such certification. Only such notes or such flavor ingredient records as are necessary to verify such certification or to show a potential or actual violation may be removed or transmitted from the certifying party's place of business: <I>Provided,</I> That, where such removal or transmittal is necessary for such purposes the relevant records and notes shall be retained as separate documents in Food and Drug Administration files, shall not be copied in other reports, and shall not be disclosed publicly other than in a judicial proceeding brought pursuant to the act or 18 U.S.C. 1001. 
</P>
<P>(j) A food to which a chemical preservative(s) is added shall, except when exempt pursuant to § 501.100, bear a label declaration stating both the common or usual name of the ingredient(s) and a separate description of its function, e.g., <I>preservative, to retard spoilage, a mold inhibitor, to help protect flavor</I> or <I>to promote color retention.</I> 
</P>
<P>(k) The label of an animal food to which any coloring has been added shall declare the coloring in the statement of ingredients in the manner specified in paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section.
</P>
<P>(1) A color additive or the lake of a color additive subject to certification under section 721(c) of the act shall be declared by the name of the color additive listed in the applicable regulation in part 74 or part 82 of this chapter, except that it is not necessary to include the “FD&amp;C” prefix or the term “No.” in the declaration, but the term “Lake” shall be included in the declaration of the lake of the certified color additive (e.g., Blue 1 Lake). Manufacturers may parenthetically declare an appropriate alternative name of the certified color additive following its common or usual name as specified in part 74 or part 82 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(2) Color additives not subject to certification may be declared as “Artificial Color,” “Artificial Color Added,” or “Color Added” (or by an equally informative term that makes clear that a color additive has been used in the food). Alternatively, such color additives may be declared as “Colored with ____” or “____ color,” the blank to be filled with the name of the color additive listed in the applicable regulation in part 73 of this chapter.

<DIV8 N="501.100" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="6">
<HEAD>§ 501.100   Animal food; exemptions from labeling.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The following foods are exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 403(i)(2) of the act (requiring a declaration on the label of the common or usual name of each ingredient when the food is fabricated from two or more ingredients). 
</P>
<P>(1) An assortment of different items of food, when variations in the items that make up different packages packed from such assortment normally occur in good packing practice and when such variations result in variations in the ingredients in different packages, with respect to any ingredient that is not common to all packages. Such exemption, however, shall be on the condition that the label shall bear, in conjunction with the names of such ingredients as are common to all packages, a statement (in terms that are as informative as practicable and that are not misleading) indicating by name other ingredients which may be present. 
</P>
<P>(2) A food having been received in bulk containers at a retail establishment, if displayed to the purchaser with either (i) the labeling of the bulk container plainly in view or (ii) a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the information required to be stated on the label pursuant to section 403(i)(2) of the act. 
</P>
<P>(3) Incidental additives that are present in a food at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food. For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(3), incidental additives are: 
</P>
<P>(i) Substances that have no technical or functional effect but are present in a food by reason of having been incorporated into the food as an ingredient of another food, in which the substance did have a functional or technical effect. 
</P>
<P>(ii) Processing aids, which are as follows: 
</P>
<P>(<I>a</I>) Substances that are added to a food during the processing of such food but are removed in some manner from the food before it is packaged in its finished form. 
</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) Substances that are added to a food during processing, are converted into constituents normally present in the food, and do not significantly increase the amount of the constituents naturally found in the food. 
</P>
<P>(<I>c</I>) Substances that are added to a food for their technical or functional effect in the processing but are present in the finished food at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food. 
</P>
<P>(iii) Substances migrating to food from equipment or packaging or otherwise affecting food that are not food additives as defined in section 201(s) of the act; or if they are food additives as so defined, they are used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to section 409 of the act. 
</P>
<P>(b) A food repackaged in a retail establishment is exempt from the following provisions of the act if the conditions specified are met. 
</P>
<P>(1) Section 403(e)(1) of the act (requiring a statement on the label of the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor). 
</P>
<P>(2) Section 403(g)(2) of the act (requiring the label of a food which purports to be or is represented as one for which a definition and standard of identity has been prescribed to bear the name of the food specified in the definition and standard and, insofar as may be required by the regulation establishing the standard the common names of the optional ingredients present in the food), if the food is displayed to the purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the information required by these provisions. 
</P>
<P>(3) Section 403(i)(1) of the act (requiring the label to bear the common or usual name of the food), if the food is displayed to the purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the common or usual name of the food, or if the common or usual name of the food is clearly revealed by its appearance. 
</P>
<P>(c) [Reserved] 
</P>
<P>(d) Except as provided by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, a shipment or other delivery of a food which is, in accordance with the practice of the trade, to be processed, labeled, or repacked in substantial quantity at an establishment other than that where originally processed or packed, shall be exempt, during the time of introduction into and movement in interstate commerce and the time of holding in such establishment, from compliance with the labeling requirements of section 403 (c), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k) of the act if: 
</P>
<P>(1) The person who introduced such shipment or delivery into interstate commerce is the operator of the establishment where such food is to be processed, labeled, or repacked; or 
</P>
<P>(2) In case such person is not such operator, such shipment or delivery is made to such establishment under a written agreement, signed by and containing the post office addresses of such person and such operator, and containing such specifications for the processing, labeling, or repacking, as the case may be, of such food in such establishment as will ensure, if such specifications are followed, that such food will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act upon completion of such processing, labeling, or repacking. Such person and such operator shall each keep a copy of such agreement until 2 years after the final shipment or delivery of such food from such establishment, and shall make such copies available for inspection at any reasonable hour to any officer or employee of the Department who requests them. 
</P>
<P>(e) Conditions affecting expiration of exemptions. 
</P>
<P>(1) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall, at the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment become void ab initio if the food comprising such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act when so removed. 
</P>
<P>(2) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall become void ab initio with respect to the person who introduced such shipment or delivery into interstate commerce upon refusal by such person to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement, as required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section. 
</P>
<P>(3) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall expire: 
</P>
<P>(i) At the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment if the food comprising such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act when so removed; or

<P>(ii) Upon refusal by the operator of the establishment where such food is to be processed, labeled, or repacked, to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement as required by such paragraph. 
</P>
<P>(f) [Reserved] 
</P>
<P>(g) The label declaration of a harmless marker used to identify a particular manufacturer's product may result in unfair competition through revealing a trade secret. Exemption from the label declaration of such a marker is granted, therefore, provided that the following conditions are met: 
</P>
<P>(1) The person desiring to use the marker without label declaration of its presence has submitted to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs full information concerning the proposed usage and the reasons why he believes label declaration of the marker should be subject to this exemption; and 
</P>
<P>(2) The person requesting the exemption has received from the Commissioner of Food and Drugs a finding that the marker is harmless and that the exemption has been granted.

<DIV8 N="501.105" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="6">
<HEAD>§ 501.105   Declaration of net quantity of contents when exempt.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear a declaration of the net quantity of contents. This shall be expressed in the terms of weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination of numerical count and weight or measure. The statement shall be in terms of fluid measure if the food is liquid, or in terms of weight if the food is solid, semisolid, or viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid; except that such statement may be in terms of dry measure if the food is a fresh fruit, fresh vegetable, or other dry commodity that is customarily sold by dry measure. If there is a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of declaring the contents of a liquid by weight, or a solid, semisolid, or viscous product by fluid measure, it may be used. Whenever the Commissioner determines that an existing practice of declaring net quantity of contents by weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination in the case of a specific packaged food does not facilitate value comparisons by consumers and offers opportunity for consumer confusion, he will by regulation designate the appropriate term or terms to be used for such commodity. 
</P>
<P>(b)(1) Statements of weight shall be in terms of avoirdupois pound and ounce. 
</P>
<P>(2) Statements of fluid measure shall be in terms of the U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, and fluid ounce subdivisions thereof, and shall: 
</P>
<P>(i) In the case of frozen food that is sold and consumed in a frozen state, express the volume at the frozen temperature. 
</P>
<P>(ii) In the case of refrigerated food that is sold in the refrigerated state, express the volume at 40 °F (4 °C). 
</P>
<P>(iii) In the case of other foods, express the volume at 68 °F (20 °C). 
</P>
<P>(3) Statements of dry measure shall be in terms of the U.S. bushel of 2,150.42 cubic inches and peck, dry quart, and dry pint subdivisions thereof. 
</P>
<P>(c) When the declaration of quantity of contents by numerical count does not give adequate information as to the quantity of food in the package, it shall be combined with such statement of weight, measure, or size of the individual units of the foods as will provide such information. 
</P>
<P>(d) The declaration may contain common or decimal fractions. A common fraction shall be in terms of halves, quarters, eighths, sixteenths, or thirty-seconds; except that if there exists a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of employing different common fractions in the net quantity declaration of a particular commodity, they may be employed. A common fraction shall be reduced to its lowest terms; a decimal fraction shall not be carried out to more than two places. A statement that includes small fractions of an ounce shall be deemed to permit smaller variations than one which does not include such fractions. 
</P>
<P>(e) The declaration shall be located on the principal display panel of the label, and with respect to packages bearing alternate principal panels it shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. 
</P>
<P>(f) The declaration shall appear as a distinct item on the principal display panel, shall be separated (by at least a space equal to the height of the lettering used in the declaration) from other printed label information appearing above or below the declaration and (by at least a space equal to twice the width of the letter “N” of the style of type used in the quantity of contents statement) from other printed label information appearing to the left or right of the declaration. It shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count (such as <I>jumbo quart</I> and <I>full gallon</I>) that tends to exaggerate the amount of the food in the container. It shall be placed on the principal display panel within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed: <I>Provided,</I> That on packages having a principal display panel of 5 square inches or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel shall not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of this part. 
</P>
<P>(g) The declaration shall accurately reveal the quantity of food in the package exclusive of wrappers and other material packed therewith; provided that in the case of foods packed in containers designed to deliver the food under pressure, the declaration shall state the net quantity of the contents that will be expelled when the instructions for use as shown on the container are followed. The propellant is included in the net quantity declaration. 
</P>
<P>(h) The declaration shall appear in conspicuous and easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast (by typography, layout, color, embossing, or molding) to other matter on the package; except that a declaration of net quantity blown, embossed, or molded on a glass or plastic surface is permissible when all label information is so formed on the surface. Requirements of conspicuousness and legibility shall include the specifications that: 
</P>
<P>(1) The ratio of height to width (of the letter) shall not exceed a differential of 3 units to 1 unit (no more than 3 times as high as it is wide). 
</P>
<P>(2) Letter heights pertain to upper case or capital letters. When upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower case letter “o” or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum standards. 
</P>
<P>(3) When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one-half the minimum height standards. 
</P>
<P>(i) The declaration shall be in letters and numerals in a type size established in relationship to the area of the principal display panel of the package and shall be uniform for all packages of substantially the same size by complying with the following type specifications:

<P>(o) Nothing in this section shall prohibit supplemental statements at locations other than the principal display panel(s) describing in nondeceptive terms the net quantity of contents; provided, that such supplemental statements of net quantity of contents shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count that tends to exaggerate the amount of the food contained in the package; for example, <I>jumbo quart</I> and <I>full gallon.</I> Dual or combination declarations of net quantity of contents as provided for in paragraphs (a), (c), and (j) of this section (for example, a combination of net weight plus numerical count, net contents plus dilution directions of a concentrate, etc.) are not regarded as supplemental net quantity statements and may be located on the principal display panel. 
</P>
<P>(p) A separate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the metric system is not regarded as a supplemental statement and an accurate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the metric system of weight or measure may also appear on the principal display panel or on other panels. 
</P>
<P>(q) The declaration of net quantity of contents shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the package. Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the course of good distribution practice or by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practice will be recognized. Variations from stated quantity of contents shall not be unreasonably large. 
</P>
<P>(r) [Reserved] 
</P>
<P>(s) On a multiunit retail package, a statement of the quantity of contents shall appear on the outside of the package and shall include the number of individual units, the quantity of each individual unit, and, in parentheses, the total quantity of contents of the multiunit package in terms of avoirdupois or fluid ounces, except that such declaration of total quantity need not be followed by an additional parenthetical declaration in terms of the largest whole units and subdivisions thereof, as required by paragraph (j)(1) of this section. A multiunit retail package may thus be properly labeled: <I>6-16 oz. bottles—(96 fl. oz.)</I> or <I>3-16 oz. cans—(net wt. 48 oz).</I> For the purposes of this section, <I>multiunit retail package</I> means a package containing two or more individually packaged units of the identical commodity and in the same quantity, intended to be sold as part of the multiunit retail package but capable of being individually sold in full compliance with all requirements of the regulations in this part. Open multiunit retail packages that do not obscure the number of units nor prevent examination of the labeling on each of the individual units are not subject to this paragraph if the labeling of each individual unit complies with the requirements of paragraphs (f) and (i) of this section. 
</P>
<P>(t) Where the declaration of net quantity of contents is in terms of net weight and/or drained weight or volume and does not accurately reflect the actual quantity of the contents or the product falls below the applicable standard of fill of container because of equipment malfunction or otherwise unintentional product variation, and the label conforms in all other respects to the requirements of this chapter, the mislabeled food product may be sold by the manufacturer or processor directly to institutions operated by Federal, State or local governments: <I>Provided,</I> That:
</P>
<P>(1) The purchaser shall sign a statement at the time of sale stating that he is aware that the product is mislabeled to include acknowledgement of the nature and extent of the mislabeling, e.g., “Actual net weight may be as low as __% below labeled quantity” and that any subsequent distribution by him of said product except for his own institutional use is unlawful. This statement shall be kept on file at the principal place of business of the manufacturer or processor for 2 years subsequent to the date of shipment of the product and shall be available to the Food and Drug Administration upon request. 
</P>
<P>(2) The product shall be labeled on the outside of its shipping container with the statement(s): 
</P>
<P>(i) When the variation concerns net weight and/or drained weight of volume—“Product Mislabeled. Actual net weight (drained weight or volume where appropriate) may be as low as __% below labeled quantity. This Product Not for Retail Distribution,” the blank to be filled in with the maximum percentage variance between the labeled and actual weight or volume of contents of the individual packages in the shipping container, and 
</P>
<P>(ii) When the variation is in regard to a fill of container standard—“Product Mislabeled. Actual fill may be as low as __% below standard of fill. This Product Not for Retail Distribution.”
</P>
<P>(3) The statements required by paragraphs (t)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, which may be consolidated where appropriate, shall appear prominently and conspicuously as compared to other printed matter on the shipping container and in boldface print or type on a clear, contrasting background in order to render them likely to be read and understood by the purchaser under ordinary conditions of purchase.

<HEAD>§ 507.1   Applicability and status.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The criteria and definitions in this part apply in determining whether an animal food is:
</P>
<P>(1) Adulterated within the meaning of:
</P>
<P>(i) Section 402(a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in that the food has been manufactured under such conditions that it is unfit for food; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in that the food has been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health; and
</P>
<P>(2) In violation of section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 264).
</P>
<P>(b) The operation of a facility that manufactures, processes, packs, or holds animal food for sale in the United States if the owner, operator, or agent in charge of such facility is required to comply with, and is not in compliance with, section 418 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or subparts C, D, E, or F of this part and § 507.7 is a prohibited act under section 301(uu) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P>(c) Animal food covered by specific current good manufacturing practice regulations also is subject to the requirements of those regulations.
</P>
<P>(d) Except as provided by § 507.12, if a facility is required to comply with subpart B of part 507 and is also required to comply with subpart B of part 117 of this chapter because the facility manufactures, processes, packs, or holds human food and animal food, then the facility may choose to comply with the requirements in subpart B of part 117, instead of subpart B of part 507, as to the manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding of animal food at that facility. If a facility is required to comply with subpart C of part 507 and is also required to comply with subpart C of part 117 of this chapter, then the facility may choose to comply with the requirements in subpart C of part 117 as to the manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding of animal food at the facility, instead of subpart C of part 507, provided the food safety plan also addresses hazards for the animal food, if applicable, that require a preventive control. When applying the requirements of part 117 of this chapter to animal food, the term “food” in part 117 includes animal food.

<DIV8 N="507.3" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="6">
<HEAD>§ 507.3   Definitions.</HEAD>
<P>The definitions and interpretations contained in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act apply to such terms when used in this part. The following definitions also apply:
</P>
<P><I>Adequate</I> means that which is needed to accomplish the intended purpose in keeping with good public (human and animal) health practice.

</P>
<P><I>Calendar day</I> means every day shown on the calendar.
</P>
<P><I>Correction</I> means an action to identify and correct a problem that occurred during the production of animal food, without other actions associated with a corrective action procedure (such as actions to reduce the likelihood that the problem will recur, evaluate all affected animal food for safety, and prevent affected animal food from entering commerce).
</P>
<P><I>Critical control point</I> means a point, step, or procedure in a food process at which control can be applied and is essential to prevent or eliminate a food safety hazard or reduce such hazard to an acceptable level.
</P>
<P><I>Environmental pathogen</I> means a pathogen capable of surviving and persisting within the manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding environment such that food for animals may be contaminated and may result in foodborne illness if that animal food is not treated to significantly minimize or prevent the environmental pathogen. Examples of environmental pathogens for the purposes of this part include <I>Listeria monocytogenes</I> and <I>Salmonella</I> spp. but do not include the spores of pathogenic sporeforming bacteria.
</P>
<P><I>Facility</I> means a domestic facility or a foreign facility that is required to register under section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in accordance with the requirements of part 1, subpart H of this chapter.
</P>
<P><I>Farm</I> means farm as defined in § 1.227 of this chapter.
</P>
<P><I>FDA</I> means the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P><I>Food</I> means food as defined in section 201(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and includes raw materials and ingredients.
</P>
<P><I>Food-contact surfaces</I> are those surfaces that contact animal food and those surfaces from which drainage, or other transfer, onto the animal food or onto surfaces that contact the animal food ordinarily occurs during the normal course of operations. “Food-contact surfaces” includes utensils and animal food-contact surfaces of equipment.
</P>
<P><I>Full-time equivalent employee</I> is a term used to represent the number of employees of a business entity for the purpose of determining whether the business qualifies for the small business exemption. The number of full-time equivalent employees is determined by dividing the total number of hours of salary or wages paid directly to employees of the business entity and of all of its affiliates and subsidiaries by the number of hours of work in 1 year, 2,080 hours (<I>i.e.,</I> 40 hours × 52 weeks). If the result is not a whole number, round down to the next lowest whole number.
</P>
<P><I>Harvesting</I> applies to farms and farm mixed-type facilities and means activities that are traditionally performed on farms for the purpose of removing raw agricultural commodities from the place they were grown or raised and preparing them for use as animal food. Harvesting is limited to activities performed on raw agricultural commodities, or on processed foods created by drying/dehydrating a raw agricultural commodity without additional manufacturing/processing, on a farm. Harvesting does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of harvesting include cutting (or otherwise separating) the edible portion of the raw agricultural commodity from the crop plant and removing or trimming part of the raw agricultural commodity (<I>e.g.,</I> foliage, husks, roots, or stems). Examples of harvesting also include cooling, field coring, filtering, gathering, hulling, shelling, sifting, threshing, trimming of outer leaves of, and washing raw agricultural commodities grown on a farm.
</P>
<P><I>Hazard</I> means any biological, chemical (including radiological), or physical agent that has the potential to cause illness or injury in humans or animals.
</P>
<P><I>Hazard requiring a preventive control</I> means a known or reasonably foreseeable hazard for which a person knowledgeable about the safe manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding of animal food would, based on the outcome of a hazard analysis (which includes an assessment of the severity of the illness or injury to humans or animals if the hazard were to occur and the probability that the hazard will occur in the absence of preventive controls), establish one or more preventive controls to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard in an animal food and components to manage those controls (such as monitoring, corrections or corrective actions, verification, and records) as appropriate to the animal food, the facility, and the nature of the preventive control and its role in the facility's food safety system.
</P>
<P><I>Holding</I> means storage of animal food and also includes activities performed incidental to storage of an animal food (<I>e.g.,</I> activities performed for the safe or effective storage of that animal food, such as fumigating animal food during storage, and drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities when the drying/dehydrating does not create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating hay or alfalfa)). Holding also includes activities performed as a practical necessity for the distribution of that animal food (such as blending of the same raw agricultural commodity and breaking down pallets), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Holding facilities could include warehouses, cold storage facilities, storage silos, grain elevators, and liquid-storage tanks.
</P>
<P><I>Known or reasonably foreseeable hazard</I> means a biological, chemical (including radiological), or physical hazard that is known to be, or has the potential to be, associated with the facility or the animal food.
</P>
<P><I>Lot</I> means the animal food produced during a period of time and identified by an establishment's specific code.
</P>
<P><I>Manufacturing/processing</I> means making animal food from one or more ingredients, or synthesizing, preparing, treating, modifying, or manipulating animal food, including food crops or ingredients. Examples of manufacturing/processing activities include: Baking, boiling, bottling, canning, cooking, cooling, cutting, distilling, drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), evaporating, eviscerating, extracting juice, extruding, formulating, freezing, grinding, homogenizing, irradiating, labeling, milling, mixing, packaging (including modified atmosphere packaging), pasteurizing, peeling, pelleting, rendering, treating to manipulate ripening, trimming, washing, or waxing. For farms and farm mixed-type facilities, manufacturing/processing does not include activities that are part of harvesting, packing, or holding.
</P>
<P><I>Microorganisms</I> means yeasts, molds, bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and microscopic parasites and includes species that are pathogens. The term “undesirable microorganisms” includes those microorganisms that are pathogens, that subject animal food to decomposition, that indicate that animal food is contaminated with filth, or that otherwise may cause animal food to be adulterated.
</P>
<P><I>Mixed-type facility</I> means an establishment that engages in both activities that are exempt from registration under section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and activities that require the establishment to be registered. An example of such a facility is a “farm mixed-type facility,” which is an establishment that is a farm, but also conducts activities outside the farm definition that require the establishment to be registered.
</P>

<P>A. The name and all pertinent information concerning the food additive, including chemical identity and composition of the food additive, its physical, chemical, and biological properties, and specifications prescribing the minimum content of the desired component(s) and identifying and limiting the reaction byproducts and other impurities. Where such information is not available, a statement as to the reasons why it is not should be submitted. 
</P>
<P>When the chemical identity and composition of the food additive is not known, the petition shall contain information in sufficient detail to permit evaluation regarding the method of manufacture and the analytical controls used during the various stages of manufacturing, processing, or packing of the food additive which are relied upon to establish that it is a substance of reproducible composition. Alternative methods and controls and variations in methods and controls within reasonable limits that do not affect the characteristics of the substance or the reliability of the controls may be specified. 
</P>
<P>If the food additive is a mixture of chemicals, the petition shall supply a list of all substances used in the synthesis, extraction, or other method of preparation, regardless of whether they undergo chemical change in the process. Each substance should be identified by its common English name and complete chemical name, using structural formulas when necessary for specific identification. If any proprietary preparation is used as a component, the proprietary name should be followed by a complete quantitative statement of composition. Reasonable alternatives for any listed substance may be specified. 
</P>
<P>If the petitioner does not himself perform all the manufacturing, processing, and packing operations for a food additive, the petition shall identify each person who will perform a part of such operations and designate the part. 
</P>
<P>The petition shall include stability data, and, if the data indicate that it is needed to ensure the identity, strength, quality, or purity of the additive, the expiration date that will be employed. 
</P>
<P>B. The amount of the food additive proposed for use and the purposes for which it is proposed, together with all directions, recommendations, and suggestions regarding the proposed use, as well as specimens of the labeling proposed for the food additive and any labeling that will be required by applicable provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act on the finished food by reason of the use of the food additive. If the additive results or may reasonably be expected to result from the use of packaging material, the petitioner shall show how this may occur and what residues may reasonably be anticipated. 
</P>
<P>(Typewritten or other draft-labeling copy will be accepted for consideration of the petition, provided a statement is made that final printed labeling identical in content to the draft copy will be submitted as soon as available and prior to the marketing of the food additive. 
</P>
<P>If the food additive is one for which a tolerance limitation is required to assure its safety, the level of use proposed should be no higher than the amount reasonably required to accomplish the intended physical or other technical effect, even though the safety data may support a higher tolerance.) 
</P>
<P>C. Data establishing that the food additive will have the intended physical or other technical effect or that it may reasonably be expected to become a component, or to affect the characteristics, directly or indirectly, of food and the amount necessary to accomplish this. These data should include information in sufficient detail to permit evaluation with control data. 
</P>
<P>D. A description of practicable methods to determine the amount of the food additive in the raw, processed, and/or finished food and of any substance formed in or on such food because of its use. The test proposed shall be one that can be used for food-control purposes and that can be applied with consistent results by any properly equipped and trained laboratory personnel. 
</P>
<P>E. Full reports of investigations made with respect to the safety of the food additive. 
</P>
<P>(A petition may be regarded as incomplete unless it includes full reports of adequate tests reasonably applicable to show whether or not the food additive will be safe for its intended use. The reports ordinarily should include detailed data derived from appropriate animal and other biological experiments in which the methods used and the results obtained are clearly set forth. The petition shall not omit without explanation any reports of investigations that would bias an evaluation of the safety of the food additive.) 
</P>
<P>F. Proposed tolerances for the food additive, if tolerances are required in order to ensure its safety. A petitioner may include a proposed regulation. 
</P>
<P>G. If submitting petition to modify an existing regulation issued pursuant to section 409(c)(1)(A) of the act, full information on each proposed change that is to be made in the original regulation must be submitted.

<HEAD>§ 582.1   Substances that are generally recognized as safe.</HEAD>
<P>(a) It is impracticable to list all substances that are generally recognized as safe for their intended use. However, by way of illustration, the Commissioner regards such common food ingredients as salt, pepper, sugar, vinegar, baking powder, and monosodium glutamate as safe for their intended use. The lists in subparts B through H of this part include additional substances that, when used for the purposes indicated, in accordance with good manufacturing or feeding practice, are regarded by the Commissioner as generally recognized as safe for such uses. 
</P>
<P>(b) For the purposes of this section, good manufacturing or feeding practice shall be defined to include the following restrictions: 
</P>
<P>(1) The quantity of a substance added to animal food does not exceed the amount reasonably required to accomplish its intended physical, nutritional, or other technical effect in food; and 
</P>
<P>(2) The quantity of a substance that becomes a component of animal food as a result of its use in the manufacturing, processing, or packaging of food, and which is not intended to accomplish any physical or other technical effect in the food itself, shall be reduced to the extent reasonably possible. 
</P>
<P>(3) The substance is of appropriate grade and is prepared and handled as a food ingredient. Upon request the Commissioner will offer an opinion, based on specifications and intended use, as to whether or not a particular grade or lot of the substance is of suitable purity for use in food and would generally be regarded as safe for the purpose intended, by experts qualified to evaluate its safety. 
</P>
<P>(c) The inclusion of substances in the list of nutrients does not constitute a finding on the part of the Department that the substance is useful as a supplement to the diet for animals. 
</P>
<P>(d) Substances that are generally recognized as safe for their intended use within the meaning of section 409 of the Act are listed in subparts B through H of this part. When the status of a substance has been reevaluated and affirmed as GRAS or deleted from subparts B through H of this part, an appropriate explanation will be noted, e.g., “affirmed as GRAS,” “food additive regulation,” “interim food additive regulation,” or “prohibited from use in food,” with a reference to the appropriate new regulation. Such notation will apply only to the specific use covered by the review, e.g., direct animal food use and/or indirect animal food use and/or animal feed use and will not affect its status for other uses not specified in the referenced regulation, pending a specific review of such other uses.

<HEAD>§ 868.3   Effective dates of requirement for premarket approval.</HEAD>
<P>A device included in this part that is classified into class III (premarket approval) shall not be commercially distributed after the date shown in the regulation classifying the device unless the manufacturer has an approval under section 515 of the act (unless an exemption has been granted under section 520(g)(2) of the act). An approval under section 515 of the act consists of FDA's issuance of an order approving an application for premarket approval (PMA) for the device or declaring completed a product development protocol (PDP) for the device.
</P>
<P>(a) Before FDA requires that a device commercially distributed before the enactment date of the amendments, or a device that has been found substantially equivalent to such a device, has an approval under section 515 of the act FDA must promulgate a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring such approval, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Such a regulation under section 515(b) of the act shall not be effective during the grace period ending on the 90th day after its promulgation or on the last day of the 30th full calendar month after the regulation that classifies the device into class III is effective, whichever is later. See section 501(f)(2)(B) of the act. Accordingly, unless an effective date of the requirement for premarket approval is shown in the regulation for a device classified into class III in this part, the device may be commercially distributed without FDA's issuance of an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device. If FDA promulgates a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring premarket approval for a device, section 501(f)(1)(A) of the act applies to the device.
</P>
<P>(b) Any new, not substantially equivalent, device introduced into commercial distribution on or after May 28, 1976, including a device formerly marketed that has been substantially altered, is classified by statute (section 513(f) of the act) into class III without any grace period and FDA must have issued an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device before the device is commercially distributed unless it is reclassified. If FDA knows that a device being commercially distributed may be a “new” device as defined in this section because of any new intended use or other reasons, FDA may codify the statutory classification of the device into class III for such new use. Accordingly, the regulation for such a class III device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution.

<P>The exemption from the requirement of premarket notification (section 510(k) of the act) for a generic type of class I or II device is only to the extent that the device has existing or reasonably foreseeable characteristics of commercially distributed devices within that generic type or, in the case of in vitro diagnostic devices, only to the extent that misdiagnosis as a result of using the device would not be associated with high morbidity or mortality. Accordingly, manufacturers of any commercially distributed class I or II device for which FDA has granted an exemption from the requirement of premarket notification must still submit a premarket notification to FDA before introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution the device when:
</P>
<P>(a) The device is intended for a use different from the intended use of a legally marketed device in that generic type of device; e.g., the device is intended for a different medical purpose, or the device is intended for lay use where the former intended use was by health care professionals only;
</P>
<P>(b) The modified device operates using a different fundamental scientific technology than a legally marketed device in that generic type of device; e.g., a surgical instrument cuts tissue with a laser beam rather than with a sharpened metal blade, or an in vitro diagnostic device detects or identifies infectious agents by using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe or nucleic acid hybridization technology rather than culture or immunoassay technology; or
</P>

<P>A device included in this part that is classified into class III (premarket approval) shall not be commercially distributed after the date shown in the regulation classifying the device unless the manufacturer has an approval under section 515 of the act (unless an exemption has been granted under section 520(g)(2) of the act). An approval under section 515 of the act consists of FDA's issuance of an order approving an application for premarket approval (PMA) for the device or declaring completed a product development protocol (PDP) for the device.
</P>
<P>(a) Before FDA requires that a device commercially distributed before the enactment date of the amendments, or a device that has been found substantially equivalent to such a device, has an approval under section 515 of the act FDA must promulgate a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring such approval, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Such a regulation under section 515(b) of the act shall not be effective during the grace period ending on the 90th day after its promulgation or on the last day of the 30th full calendar month after the regulation that classifies the device into class III is effective, whichever is later. See section 501(f)(2)(B) of the act. Accordingly, unless an effective date of the requirement for premarket approval is shown in the regulation for a device classified into class III in this part, the device may be commercially distributed without FDA's issuance of an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device. If FDA promulgates a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring premarket approval for a device, section 501(f)(1)(A) of the act applies to the device.
</P>
<P>(b) Any new, not substantially equivalent, device introduced into commercial distribution on or after May 28, 1976, including a device formerly marketed that has been substantially altered, is classified by statute (section 513(f) of the act) into class III without any grace period and FDA must have issued an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device before the device is commercially distributed unless it is reclassified. If FDA knows that a device being commercially distributed may be a “new” device as defined in this section because of any new intended use or other reasons, FDA may codify the statutory classification of the device into class III for such new use. Accordingly, the regulation for such a class III device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution.

<P>The exemption from the requirement of premarket notification (section 510(k) of the act) for a generic type of class I or II device is only to the extent that the device has existing or reasonably foreseeable characteristics of commercially distributed devices within that generic type or, in the case of in vitro diagnostic devices, only to the extent that misdiagnosis as a result of using the device would not be associated with high morbidity or mortality. Accordingly, manufacturers of any commercially distributed class I or II device for which FDA has granted an exemption from the requirement of premarket notification must still submit a premarket notification to FDA before introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution the device when:
</P>
<P>(a) The device is intended for a use different from the intended use of a legally marketed device in that generic type of device; e.g., the device is intended for a different medical purpose, or the device is intended for lay use where the former intended use was by health care professionals only;

<DIV8 N="872.3" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="8">
<HEAD>§ 872.3   Effective dates of requirement for premarket approval.</HEAD>
<P>A device included in this part that is classified into class III (premarket approval) shall not be commercially distributed after the date shown in the regulation classifying the device unless the manufacturer has an approval under section 515 of the act (unless an exemption has been granted under section 520(g)(2) of the act). An approval under section 515 of the act consists of FDA's issuance of an order approving an application for premarket approval (PMA) for the device or declaring completed a product development protocol (PDP) for the device. 
</P>
<P>(a) Before FDA requires that a device commercially distributed before the enactment date of the amendments, or a device that has been found substantially equivalent to such a device, has an approval under section 515 of the act, FDA must promulgate a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring such approval, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Such a regulation under section 515(b) of the act shall not be effective during the grace period ending on the 90th day after its promulgation or on the last day of the 30th full calendar month after the regulation that classifies the device into class III is effective, whichever is later. See section 501(f)(2)(B) of the act. Accordingly, unless an effective date of the requirement for premarket approval is shown in the regulation for a device classified into class III in this part, the device may be commercially distributed without FDA's issuance of an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device. If FDA promulgates a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring premarket approval for a device, section 501(f)(1)(A) of the act applies to the device. 
</P>
<P>(b) Any new, not substantially equivalent, device introduced into commercial distribution on or after May 28, 1976, including a device formerly marketed that has been substantially altered, is classified by statute (section 513(f) of the act) into class III without any grace period and FDA must have issued an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device before the device is commercially distributed unless it is reclassified. If FDA knows that a device being commercially distributed may be a “new” device as defined in this section because of any new intended use or other reasons, FDA may codify the statutory classification of the device into class III for such new use. Accordingly, the regulation for such a class III device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution. 
</P>
<P>(c) A device identified in a regulation in this part that is classified into class III and that is subject to the transitional provisions of section 520(1) of the act is automatically classified by statute into class III and must have an approval under section 515 of the act before being commercially distributed. Accordingly, the regulation for such a class III transitional device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution.

<HEAD>§ 872.9   Limitations of exemptions from section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act).</HEAD>
<P>The exemption from the requirement of premarket notification (section 510(k) of the act) for a generic type of class I or II device is only to the extent that the device has existing or reasonably foreseeable characteristics of commercially distributed devices within that generic type or, in the case of in vitro diagnostic devices, only to the extent that misdiagnosis as a result of using the device would not be associated with high morbidity or mortality. Accordingly, manufacturers of any commercially distributed class I or II device for which FDA has granted an exemption from the requirement of premarket notification must still submit a premarket notification to FDA before introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution the device when:
</P>
<P>(a) The device is intended for a use different from the intended use of a legally marketed device in that generic type of device; e.g., the device is intended for a different medical purpose, or the device is intended for lay use where the former intended use was by health care professionals only;
</P>
<P>(b) The modified device operates using a different fundamental scientific technology than a legally marketed device in that generic type of device; e.g., a surgical instrument cuts tissue with a laser beam rather than with a sharpened metal blade, or an in vitro diagnostic device detects or identifies infectious agents by using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe or nucleic acid hybridization technology rather than culture or immunoassay technology; or
</P>
<P>(c) The device is an in vitro device that is intended:
</P>
<P>(1) For use in the diagnosis, monitoring, or screening of neoplastic diseases with the exception of immunohistochemical devices;
</P>
<P>(2) For use in screening or diagnosis of familial or acquired genetic disorders, including inborn errors of metabolism;
</P>
<P>(3) For measuring an analyte that serves as a surrogate marker for screening, diagnosis, or monitoring life-threatening diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), chronic or active hepatitis, tuberculosis, or myocardial infarction or to monitor therapy;
</P>
<P>(4) For assessing the risk of cardiovascular diseases;
</P>
<P>(5) For use in diabetes management;
</P>
<P>(6) For identifying or inferring the identity of a microorganism directly from clinical material;
</P>
<P>(7) For detection of antibodies to microorganisms other than immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgG assays when the results are not qualitative, or are used to determine immunity, or the assay is intended for use in matrices other than serum or plasma;
</P>
<P>(8) For noninvasive testing as defined in § 812.3(k) of this chapter; and
</P>
<P>(9) For near patient testing (point of care).

<HEAD>§ 1114.27   Review procedure.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Acceptance review.</I> (1) After an applicant submits a PMTA, FDA will perform an initial review of the PMTA to determine whether it may be accepted for further review. FDA may refuse to accept an application that:
</P>
<P>(i) Does not comply with the applicable format requirements in § 1114.7(b), § 1114.15, or § 1114.17 (as applicable);
</P>
<P>(ii) Is not administratively complete because it does not appear to contain the information required by § 1114.7 (excluding product samples), § 1114.15 or § 1114.17, as applicable;
</P>
<P>(iii) Does not pertain to a tobacco product subject to chapter IX of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as required by § 1105.10 of this chapter); or
</P>
<P>(iv) FDA can otherwise refuse to accept under § 1105.10.
</P>
<P>(2) If FDA accepts an application for further review, FDA will issue an acknowledgement letter to the applicant that specifies the PMTA STN.

</P>
<P>(3) If FDA refuses to accept an application, FDA will issue a letter to the applicant identifying the deficiencies, where practicable, that prevented FDA from accepting the application.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Filing review.</I> (1) After accepting a PMTA, FDA will make a threshold determination of whether the application contains sufficient information to permit a substantive review. FDA may refuse to file a PMTA if any of the following applies:
</P>

<P>(ii) The application does not contain any substantive information, including information from published literature or bridged from an investigation of another tobacco product, regarding each of the following topics.
</P>
<P>(A) The health risks of the new tobacco product as described in either § 1114.7(k)(1)(i)(A), (B), or (C));
</P>
<P>(B) The health risks of the new tobacco product compared to the health risks generally presented by products in the same product category as well as products in at least one different category that are used by the consumers an applicant expects will use its new tobacco product (as described in a portion of § 1114.7(k)(1)(i)(D)).
</P>
<P>(C) The abuse liability of the new tobacco product (as set forth in § 1114.7(k)(1)(ii)(A));
</P>
<P>(D) How consumers would be expected to actually use the product, such as use frequency, use trends over time, and how such use affects the health risks of the product to individual users (as described in § 1114.7(k)(1)(ii)(B));
</P>
<P>(E) The potential impact that the marketing of the new tobacco product would have on the likelihood that current tobacco product users would change their tobacco product use behavior, such as starting to using the new tobacco product, using the product in conjunction with other tobacco products, or, after using the product, switching to or switch back to other tobacco products that may present increased risks to individual health (<I>i.e.,</I> any of the information set forth in either § 1114.7(k)(1)(ii)(C), (D), (E), or (F));
</P>
<P>(F) The impact of the tobacco product and its label, labeling, or advertising, to the extent that advertising has been studied, on tobacco product use behavior of current nonusers of tobacco products (<I>i.e.,</I> any of the information described in § 1114.7(k)(1)(iii));
</P>
<P>(G) The impact of the product and its label, labeling, or advertising, to the extent that advertising has been studied, on individuals' perception of the product and their use intentions (<I>i.e.,</I> any of the information described in § 1114.7(k)(1)(iv)); and
</P>
<P>(H) The ways in which human factors can affect the health risks of the new tobacco product (<I>i.e.,</I> any of the information described in § 1114.7(k)(1)(v));
</P>
<P>(iii) The PMTA contains a false statement of material fact;
</P>
<P>(iv) The PMTA is a supplemental PMTA that does not comply with § 1114.15; or
</P>
<P>(v) The PMTA is a resubmission that does not comply with § 1114.17.
</P>
<P>(2) If FDA refuses to file an application, FDA will issue a letter to the applicant identifying the deficiencies, where practicable, that prevented FDA from filing the application.
</P>
<P>(3) If FDA files an application, FDA will issue a filing letter to the applicant.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Application review.</I> (1) Except as described in this paragraph and § 1114.9(b), within 180 days of receipt of an application described in section 910(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act meeting the filing requirements set out in 1114.27(b), FDA will complete its review of the PMTA and act on the application.
</P>
<P>(2) FDA will begin substantive review of the application after it is filed under paragraph (b) of this section. FDA may communicate with the applicant as set forth under § 1114.25 to seek additional or clarifying information.
</P>
<P>(3) FDA may refer the PMTA or portions of the PMTA, upon its own initiative or applicant request, to TPSAC for reference and for the submission of a report and recommendation respecting the application, together with all underlying data and the reasons or basis for the recommendation.
</P>
<P>(4) FDA may conduct inspections of the applicant's manufacturing sites, and sites and entities involved with clinical and nonclinical research (including third parties and contract research organizations) to support FDA's review of the PMTA. Where an applicant prevents FDA from scheduling and conducting inspections that are necessary for FDA to complete its review of the PMTA in a timely manner, FDA may pause the 180-day review period for the number of days necessary to complete the inspection.
</P>
<P>(5) FDA may defer review of a PMTA for a new product that, if introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, would be adulterated or misbranded due to the manufacturer or importer's failure to comply with user fee payment and reporting requirements under part 1150.

<HEAD>§ 1271.150   Current good tissue practice requirements.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> This subpart D and subpart C of this part set forth current good tissue practice (CGTP) requirements. You must follow CGTP requirements to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases by HCT/Ps (e.g., by ensuring that the HCT/Ps do not contain communicable disease agents, that they are not contaminated, and that they do not become contaminated during manufacturing). Communicable diseases include, but are not limited to, those transmitted by viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy agents. CGTP requirements govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of HCT/Ps, including but not limited to all steps in recovery, donor screening, donor testing, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution. The CGTP provisions specifically governing determinations of donor eligibility, including donor screening and testing, are set out separately in subpart C of this part.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Core CGTP requirements.</I> The following are core CGTP requirements:
</P>
<P>(1) Requirements relating to facilities in § 1271.190(a) and (b);
</P>
<P>(2) Requirements relating to environmental control in § 1271.195(a);
</P>
<P>(3) Requirements relating to equipment in § 1271.200(a);
</P>
<P>(4) Requirements relating to supplies and reagents in § 1271.210(a) and (b);
</P>
<P>(5) Requirements relating to recovery in § 1271.215;
</P>
<P>(6) Requirements relating to processing and process controls in § 1271.220;
</P>
<P>(7) Requirements relating to labeling controls in § 1271.250(a) and (b);
</P>
<P>(8) Requirements relating to storage in § 1271.260 (a) through (d);
</P>
<P>(9) Requirements relating to receipt, predistribution shipment, and distribution of an HCT/P in § 1271.265(a) through (d); and
</P>
<P>(10) Requirements relating to donor eligibility determinations, donor screening, and donor testing in §§ 1271.50, 1271.75, 1271.80, and 1271.85.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Compliance with applicable requirements</I>—(1) <I>Manufacturing arrangements</I> (i) If you are an establishment that engages in only some operations subject to the regulations in this subpart and subpart C of this part, and not others, then you need only comply with those requirements applicable to the operations that you perform.
</P>
<P>(ii) If you engage another establishment (e.g., a laboratory to perform communicable disease testing, or an irradiation facility to perform terminal sterilization), under a contract, agreement, or other arrangement, to perform any step in manufacture for you, that establishment is responsible for complying with requirements applicable to that manufacturing step.
</P>
<P>(iii) Before entering into a contract, agreement, or other arrangement with another establishment to perform any step in manufacture for you, you must ensure that the establishment complies with applicable CGTP requirements. If, during the course of this contract, agreement, or other arrangement, you become aware of information suggesting that the establishment may no longer be in compliance with such requirements, you must take reasonable steps to ensure the establishment complies with those requirements. If you determine that the establishment is not in compliance with those requirements, you must terminate your contract, agreement, or other arrangement with the establishment.
</P>
<P>(2) If you are the establishment that determines that an HCT/P meets all release criteria and makes the HCT/P available for distribution, whether or not you are the actual distributor, you are responsible for reviewing manufacturing and tracking records to determine that the HCT/P has been manufactured and tracked in compliance with the requirements of this subpart and subpart C of this part and any other applicable requirements.
</P>
<P>(3) With the exception of §§ 1271.150(c) and 1271.155 of this subpart, the regulations in this subpart are not being implemented for reproductive HCT/Ps described in § 1271.10 and regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and the regulations in this part, or for the establishments that manufacture them.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Compliance with parts 210, 211, and 820 of this chapter.</I> With respect to HCT/Ps that are drugs (subject to review under an application submitted under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or under a biological product license application under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act) or that are devices (subject to premarket review or notification under the device provisions of the act or under a biological product license application under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act), the procedures contained in this subpart and in subpart C of this part and the current good manufacturing practice regulations in parts 210 and 211 of this chapter and the quality system regulations in part 820 of this chapter supplement, and do not supersede, each other unless the regulations explicitly provide otherwise. In the event that a regulation in part 1271 of this chapter is in conflict with a requirement in parts 210, 211, or 820 of this chapter, the regulations more specifically applicable to the product in question will supersede the more general.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Where appropriate.</I> When a requirement is qualified by “where appropriate,” it is deemed to be “appropriate” unless you can document justification otherwise. A requirement is “appropriate” if nonimplementation of the requirement could reasonably be expected to result in the HCT/P not meeting its specified requirements related to prevention of introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases, or in your inability to carry out any necessary corrective action.

<HEAD>§ 1271.270   Records.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> You must maintain records concurrently with the performance of each step required in this subpart and subpart C of this part. Any requirement in this part that an action be documented involves the creation of a record, which is subject to the requirements of this section. All records must be accurate, indelible, and legible. The records must identify the person performing the work and the dates of the various entries, and must be as detailed as necessary to provide a complete history of the work performed and to relate the records to the particular HCT/P involved.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Records management system.</I> You must establish and maintain a records management system relating to core CGTP requirements. Under this system, records pertaining to a particular HCT/P must be maintained in such a way as to facilitate review of the HCT/Ps history before making it available for distribution and, if necessary, subsequent to the HCT/Ps release as part of a followup evaluation or investigation. Records pertinent to the manufacture of HCT/Ps (e.g., labeling and packaging procedures, and equipment logs) must also be maintained and organized under the records management system. If records are maintained in more than one location, then the records management system must be designed to ensure prompt identification, location, and retrieval of all records.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Methods of retention.</I> You may maintain records required under this subpart electronically, as original paper records, or as true copies such as photocopies, microfiche, or microfilm. Equipment that is necessary to make the records available and legible, such as computer and reader equipment, must be readily available. Records stored in electronic systems must be backed up.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Length of retention.</I> You must retain all records for 10 years after their creation, unless stated otherwise in this part. However, you must retain the records pertaining to a particular HCT/P at least 10 years after the date of its administration, or if the date of administration is not known, then at least 10 years after the date of the HCT/Ps distribution, disposition, or expiration, whichever is latest. You must retain records for archived specimens of dura mater for 10 years after the appropriate disposition of the specimens.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Contracts and agreements.</I> You must maintain the name and address and a list of the responsibilities of any establishment that performs a manufacturing step for you. This information must be available during an inspection conducted under § 1271.400.

<DIV8 N="1271.290" TYPE="SECTION" VOLUME="8">
<HEAD>§ 1271.290   Tracking.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> If you perform any step in the manufacture of an HCT/P in which you handle the HCT/P, you must track each such HCT/P in accordance with this section, to facilitate the investigation of actual or suspected transmission of communicable disease and take appropriate and timely corrective action.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>System of HCT/P tracking.</I> (1) You must establish and maintain a system of HCT/P tracking that enables the tracking of all HCT/Ps from:
</P>
<P>(i) The donor to the consignee or final disposition; and
</P>
<P>(ii) The consignee or final disposition to the donor.
</P>
<P>(2) Alternatively, if you are an establishment that performs some but not all of the steps in the manufacture of an HCT/P in which you handle the HCT/P, you may participate in a system of HCT/P tracking established and maintained by another establishment responsible for other steps in the manufacture of the same HCT/P, provided that the tracking system complies with all the requirements of this section.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Distinct identification code.</I> As part of your tracking system, you must ensure: That each HCT/P that you manufacture is assigned and labeled with a distinct identification code, e.g., alphanumeric, that relates the HCT/P to the donor and to all records pertaining to the HCT/P; and that labeling includes information designed to facilitate effective tracking, using the distinct identification code, from the donor to the recipient and from the recipient to the donor. Except as described in § 1271.55(a)(1), you must create such a code specifically for tracking, and it may not include an individual's name, social security number, or medical record number. You may adopt a distinct identification code assigned by another establishment engaged in the manufacturing process, or you may assign a new code. If you assign a new code to an HCT/P, you must establish and maintain procedures for relating the new code to the old code.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Tracking from consignee to donor.</I> As part of your tracking system, you must establish and maintain a method for recording the distinct identification code and type of each HCT/P distributed to a consignee to enable tracking from the consignee to the donor.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Tracking from donor to consignee or final disposition.</I> As part of your tracking system, you must establish and maintain a method for documenting the disposition of each of your HCT/Ps, to enable tracking from the donor to the consignee or final disposition. The information you maintain must permit the prompt identification of the consignee of the HCT/P, if any.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Consignees.</I> At or before the time of distribution of an HCT/P to a consignee, you must inform the consignee in writing of the requirements in this section and of the tracking system that you have established and are maintaining to comply with these requirements.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Requirements specific to dura mater donors.</I> You must archive appropriate specimens from each donor of dura mater, under appropriate storage conditions, and for the appropriate duration, to enable testing of the archived material for evidence of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, and to enable appropriate disposition of any affected nonadministered dura mater tissue, if necessary.
